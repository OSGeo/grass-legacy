Test data for arc.to.grass from the Soil Conservation Service (SCS)

f1.lin, f1.lab, and f1.txt are the lines, label-points, and label-text
files for an ARC/INFO polygon coverage.  A neatline is "built-in" to 
this coverage.  f1.txt is the same as the f1.txt.raw file, except that
the header has been chopped off.  the original version of v.in.arc
was not able to handle this header.

f2.lin and f2.txt are the lines and label-text files for an ARC/INFO
lines coverage.  f2.txt is the same as the f1.txt.raw file, except that
the header has been chopped off.  the original version of v.in.arc
was not able to handle this header.
