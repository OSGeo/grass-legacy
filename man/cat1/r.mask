r.mask <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	    <main> r.mask



NAME
     r.mask - Establishes or removes the current working mask.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.mask

DESCRIPTION
     The r.mask	program	allows the user	to block out certain
     areas of a	map from analysis, by "hiding" them from sight of
     other GRASS programs.  This is done by establishing a mask.
     While a mask exists, most GRASS programs will operate only
     on	data falling inside the	masked area, and ignore	any data
     falling outside of	the mask.

     Because the mask is actually only a reclass file called
     "MASK" that is created when the user identifies a mask using
     r.mask, it	can be copied, renamed,	removed, and used in
     analyses, just like other GRASS raster map	layers.	 The user
     should be aware that a mask remains in place until	a user
     renames it	to something other than	"MASK",	or removes it
     using r.mask or g.remove.

     r.mask provides the following options:

	    1	  Remove the current mask
	    2	  Identify a new mask
	  RETURN  Exit from program

     The user establishes a new	mask by	choosing option	(2).  The
     user will be asked	to name	an existing raster map layer from
     among those available in the current mapset search	path.
     Once done,	the user is shown a listing of this map's
     categories, and is	asked to assign	a value	of "1" or "0" to
     each map category.	 Areas assigned	category value "1" will
     become part of the	mask's surface,	while areas assigned
     category value "0"	will become "no	data" areas in the MASK
     file.

     If	a category is not assigned category value "1" it will
     automatically be assigned the category value "0" in the
     resulting MASK file.  Any cells falling in	category "0" will
     fall outside the newly formed mask, and their presence will
     be	ignored	by GRASS programs run later on,	as long	as the
     MASK file remains in place.

NOTES
     The above method for specifying a "mask" may seem
     counterintuitive.	Areas inside the mask are not hidden;
     areas outside the mask will be ignored until the MASK file
     is	removed.

r.mask <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	    <main> r.mask



     This program actually creates a raster map	layer (reclass
     type) called MASK,	 which can be manipulated (renamed,
     removed, copied, etc.) like any other raster map layer.

     Somewhat similar program functions	to those performed by
     r.mask can	be done	using r.mapcalc, g.region, and other
     programs.

     This program can only be run interactively.

     Note that some programs, like r.stats, have options that
     allow the user to see the effects of the current mask
     without removing the current mask.	 See, for example, use of
     the -m option for r.stats.
