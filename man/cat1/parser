NAME
     GRASS parser interface - A	set of GRASS routines that
     standardizes GRASS	commands.

DESCRIPTION
     A set of routines in GRASS	provides a mechanism for
     command-line parsing.  The	routines standardize commands
     that expect command-line arguments.  When a user is familiar
     with the general form of command-line input as defined by
     the parser, it simplifies the necessity of	remembering (or
     at	least guessing)	required command-line arguments	for any
     GRASS command.

     The parser	behaves	in one of three	ways:

	  If no	command-line arguments are entered by the user,
	  the parser searches for an interactive version of the
	  command.  If it is found, control is passed over to
	  this interactive version.  If	it is not found, the
	  parser prompts the user for programmer-defined options
	  and flags.  This prompting conforms to the same
	  standard for every GRASS command that	uses the parser
	  routines.

	  If command-line arguments are	entered	but do not
	  include all the options and flags that the programmer
	  has defined as required arguments, three things happen:
	  1) the parser	passes an error	message	to the user
	  indicating which required options and/or flags were
	  missing from the command-line, 2) then the parser
	  displays a complete usage message for	that command, and
	  finally 3) the parser	cancels	execution of the command.

	  If all necessary options and flags are entered on the
	  command line by the user, the	parser executes	the
	  command with the given options and flags.



     This page was derived from	the GRASS 4.1 Programmer's
     Manual, Command-Line Parsing, which offers	detailed
     information about the GRASS parsing routines.
