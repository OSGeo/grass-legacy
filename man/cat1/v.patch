NAME
     v.patch - Creates a new binary vector map layer by	combining
     other binary vector map layers.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.patch
     v.patch help
     v.patch input=name[,name,...] output=name

DESCRIPTION
     v.patch allows the	user to	combine	any number of vector map
     layers together to	create one composite vector map	layer.

     Parameters:

     input=name,name, ...    Name(s) of	input vector map(s) to be
			     patched together.

     output=name	     Name assigned to composite	"patched"
			     vector output map.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the names of the	vector map(s) to be patched and
     the name of an output file	to store the resulting composite
     patched vector map	on the command line, in	the form:

	  v.patch input=name[,name,...]	output=name

     Alternately, if the user runs v.patch without specifying
     input and output file names on the	command	line (by typing
     simply v.patch), the program will prompt the user for inputs
     using the standard	GRASS interface	described in the manual
     entry for parser.

NOTES
     The vector	map layers to be patched together must exist in
     the user's	current	mapset search path, and	the composite
     vector map	layer name given must not already exist	in the
     user's current mapset.

     After running v.patch, the	header file will contain only
     information taken from the	first input file name given in
     the string	input=name,name, ..., with the exception of the
     geographic	region's edge information, and the scale and
     threshold information.  (The user's current geographic
     region settings are ignored; this information is instead
     extracted from the	vector file headers.)  In the new
     composite vector map layer, the boundaries	of the geographic
     region will be expanded to	encompass all of the geographic
     area included in the map layers being patched, and	the scale
     will be set equal to the smallest (i.e., most gross) scale

     used by any of the	patched	map layers (this will affect
     default node-snapping thresholds).	 The map threshold is
     calculated	automatically from the map scales given	in the
     file headers, and (currently) is not used directly.  The
     composite vector map layer's header will probably need to be
     edited; this can be done from within the GRASS program
     v.digit.

     The GRASS programs	v.mkgrid and v.mkquads can be used to
     ensure that the borders of	the maps to be patched together
     align neatly.

     Any vectors that are duplicated among the maps being patched
     together (e.g., border lines) will	have to	be edited or
     removed after v.patch is run.  Such editing can be	done
     using v.digit.

     After running v.patch the user must run v.support on the
     composite vector map layer	in order to create a dig_plus
     (topology)	file for it.  At this time, you	can request that
     a very small snapping threshold be	used, to cause the nodes
     that match	up across vector map layers to snap together
     without affecting the integrity of	the remainder of the
     vector map	layer.

BUGS
     The dig_cats and reg file information for the maps	being
     patched together is not copied to the composite, patched map
     layer.  The user should therefore run v.support on	the
     output file produced by this program.
