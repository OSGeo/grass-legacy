NAME
     r.watershed4.0 - Watershed	basin analysis program.
     (GRASS 4.0	Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.watershed4.0
     r.watershed4.0 help
     r.watershed4.0 [-m4] elevation=name [depression=name] [flow=name]
	[disturbed.land=name|value] [blocking=name] [threshold=value] [max.slope.length=value]
	[accumulation=name] [drainage=name] [basin=name] [stream=name]
	[half.basin=name] [visual=name]	[length.slope=name] [slope.steepness=name] [armsed=name]

DESCRIPTION
     This is the GRASS 4.0 version of this program; the	GRASS 4.1
     version is	available as r.watershed. Note also that the the
     armsed sedimentation calculation facility is not available.

     r.watershed4.0 generates a	set of maps indicating:	1) the
     location of watershed basins, 2) information to interface
     with ARMSED, a storm-water	runoff and sedimentation yield
     model, and	3) the LS and S	factors	of the Revised Universal
     Soil Loss Equation	(RUSLE).

     r.watershed4.0 can	be run either interactively or non-
     interactively.  If	the user types

	  r.watershed4.0

     on	the command line without program arguments, the	program
     will prompt the user with a verbose description of	the input
     maps.  The	interactive version of r.watershed4.0 can prepare
     inputs to lumped-parameter	hydrologic models.  After a
     verbose interactive session, r.watershed4.0 will query the
     user for a	number of map layers.  Each map	layer's	values
     will be tabulated by watershed basin and sent to an output
     file.  This output	file is	organized to ease data entry into
     a lumped-parameter	hydrologic model program.  The non-
     interactive version of r.watershed4.0 cannot create this
     file.

     The user can run the program non-interactively, by
     specifying	input map names	on the command line.  Parameter
     names may be specified by their full names, or by any
     initial string that distinguish them from other parameter
     names.  In	r.watershed4.0's case, the first two letters of
     each name sufficiently distinguishes parameter names.  For
     example, the two expressions below	are equivalent inputs to
     r.watershed4.0:

       r.watershed4.0 el=elev.map th=100 st=stream.map
       ba=basin.map

       stream=stream.map basin=basin.map

OPTIONS
     -m	  Without this flag set, the entire analysis is	run in
	  memory maintained by the operating system.  This can be
	  limiting, but	is relatively fast.  Setting the flag
	  causes the program to	manage memory on disk which
	  allows larger	maps to	be processes but is considerably
	  slower.

     -4	  Allow	only horizontal	and vertical flow of water.
	  Stream and slope lengths are approximately the same as
	  outputs from default surface flow (allows horizontal,
	  vertical, and	diagonal flow of water).  This flag will
	  also make the	drainage basins	look more homogeneous.

     elevation
	  Input	map: Elevation on which	entire analysis	is based.

     depression
	  Input	map:  Map layer	of actual depressions in the
	  landscape that are large enough to slow and store
	  surface runoff from a	storm event.  Any non-zero values
	  indicate depressions.

     flow Input	map: amount of overland	flow per cell.	This map
	  indicates the	amount of overland flow	units that each
	  cell will contribute to the watershed	basin model.
	  Overland flow	units represent	the amount of overland
	  flow each cell contributes to	surface	flow.  If
	  omitted, a value of one (1) is assumed.

     disturbed.land
	  Raster map input layer or value containing the percent
	  of disturbed land (i.e., croplands, and construction
	  sites) where the raster or input value of 17 equals
	  17%.	If no map or value is given, r.watershed4.0
	  assumes no disturbed land.  This input is used for the
	  RUSLE	calculations.

     blocking
	  Input	map: terrain that will block overland surface
	  flow.	 Terrain that will block overland surface flow
	  and restart the slope	length for the RUSLE.  Any non-
	  zero values indicate blocking	terrain.

     threshold
	  The minimum size of an exterior watershed basin in
	  cells, or overland flow units.

     max.slope.length



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			2






r.watershed4.0 <main> GRASS Reference Manual<main> r.watershed4.0



	  Input	value indicating the maximum length of overland
	  surface flow in meters.  If overland flow travels
	  greater than the maximum length, the program assumes
	  the maximum length (it assumes that landscape
	  characteristics not discernable in the digital
	  elevation model exist	that maximize the slope	length).
	  This input is	used for the RUSLE calculations	and is a
	  sensitive parameter.

     accumulation
	  Output map: number of	cells that drain through each
	  cell.	 The absolute value of each cell in this output
	  map layer is the amount of overland flow that	traverses
	  the cell.  This value	will be	the number of upland
	  cells	plus one if no overland	flow map is given.  If
	  the overland flow map	is given, the value will be in
	  overland flow	units.	Negative numbers indicate that
	  those	cells possibly have surface runoff from	outside
	  of the current geographic region.  Thus, any cells with
	  negative values cannot have their surface runoff and
	  sedimentation	yields calculated accurately.

     drainage
	  Output map: drainage direction.  Provides the	"aspect"
	  for each cell.  Multiplying positive values by 45 will
	  give the direction in	degrees	that the surface runoff
	  will travel from that	cell.  The value -1 indicates
	  that the cell	is a depression	area (defined by the
	  depression input map).  Other	negative values	indicate
	  that surface runoff is leaving the boundaries	of the
	  current geographic region.  The absolute value of these
	  negative cells indicates the direction of flow.

     basin
	  Output map: Unique label for each watershed basin.
	  Each basin will be given a unique positive even
	  integer.  Areas along	edges may not be large enough to
	  create an exterior watershed basin.  0 values	indicate
	  that the cell	is not part of a complete watershed basin
	  in the current geographic region.

     stream
	  Output map: stream segments.	Values correspond to the
	  watershed basin values.

     half.basin
	  Output map: each half-basin is given a unique	value.
	  Watershed basins are divided into left and right sides.
	  The right-hand side cell of the watershed basin
	  (looking upstream) are given even values corresponding
	  to the watershed basin values.  The left-hand	side
	  cells	of the watershed basin are given odd values which



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			3






r.watershed4.0 <main> GRASS Reference Manual<main> r.watershed4.0



	  are one less than the	value of the watershed basin.

     visual
	  Output map: useful for visual	display	of results.
	  Surface runoff accumulation with the values modified to
	  provide for easy display.  All negative accumulation
	  values are changed to	zero.  All positive values above
	  the basin threshold are given	the value of the basin
	  threshold.

     length.slope
	  Output map: slope length and steepness (LS) factor.
	  Contains the LS factor for the Revised Universal Soil
	  Loss Equation.  Equations taken from Revised Universal
	  Soil Loss Equation for Western Rangelands (see SEE ALSO
	  section).  Since the LS factor is a small number, it is
	  multiplied by	100 for	the GRASS output map.

     slope.steepness
	  Output map: slope steepness (S) factor for RUSLE.
	  Contains the revised S factor	for the	Universal Soil
	  Loss Equation.  Equations taken from article entitled
	  Revised Slope	Steepness Factor for the Universal Soil
	  Loss Equation	(see SEE ALSO section).	 Since the S
	  factor is a small number (usually less than one), it is
	  multiplied by	100 for	the GRASS output map layer.

NOTES
     There are two versions of this program: ram and seg.  Which
     is	run by r.watershed4.0 depends on whether the -m	flag is
     set.  ram uses virtual memory managed by the operating
     system to store all the data structures and is faster than
     seg;  seg uses the	GRASS segment library which manages data
     in	disk files.  seg allows	other processes	to operate on the
     same CPU, even when the current geographic	region is huge.
     Due to memory requirements	of both	programs, it will be
     quite easy	to run out of memory.  If ram runs out of memory
     and the resolution	size of	the current geographic region
     cannot be increased, either more memory  needs to be added
     to	the computer, or the swap space	size needs to be
     increased.	 If seg	runs out of memory, additional disk space
     needs to be freed up for the program to run.

     seg uses the AT least-cost	search algorithm to determine the
     flow of water over	the landscape (see SEE ALSO section).
     The algorithm produces results similar to those obtained
     when running r.cost and r.drain on	every cell on the map.

     In	many situations, the elevation data will be too	finely
     detailed for the amount of	time or	memory available.
     Running r.watershed4.0 will require use of	a coarser
     resolution.  To make the results more closely resemble the



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			4






r.watershed4.0 <main> GRASS Reference Manual<main> r.watershed4.0



     finer terrain data, create	a map layer containing the lowest
     elevation values at the coarser resolution.  This is done
     by:  1) Setting the current geographic region equal to the
     elevation map layer, and 2) Using the neighborhood	command
     to	find the lowest	value for an area equal	in size	to the
     desired resolution.  For example, if the resolution of the
     elevation data is 30 meters and the resolution of the
     geographic	region for r.watershed4.0 will be 90 meters:  use
     the minimum function for a	3 by 3 neighborhood.  After going
     to	the resolution at which	r.watershed4.0 will be run,
     r.watershed4.0 will be taking values from the neighborhood
     output map	layer that represents the minimum elevation
     within the	region of the coarser cell.

     The minimum size of drainage basins is only relevant for
     those basins that have no basins draining into them (they
     are called	exterior basins).  An interior drainage	basin has
     the area that flows into an interior stream segment.  Thus,
     interior drainage basins can be of	any size.

     The r.watershed4.0	program	does not require the user to have
     the current geographic region filled with elevation values.
     Areas without elevation data MUST be masked out using the
     r.mask command.  Areas masked out will be treated as if they
     are off the edge of the region.  Masks will reduce	the
     memory necessary to run the program.  Masking out
     unimportant areas can significantly reduce	processing time
     if	the watersheds of interest occupies a small percentage of
     the overall area.

     Zero data values will be treated as elevation data	(not
     no_data).	If there are zero data along the edges of the
     current region, that edge will not	be able	to propagate
     negative accumulation data	to the rest of the map.	 This
     might give	users a	false sense of security	about the quality
     of	their data. If there are incomplete data in the	elevation
     map layer,	users should mask out those areas.
