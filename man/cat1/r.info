NAME
     r.info - Outputs basic information	about a	user-specified
     raster map	layer.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.info
     r.info help
     r.info map=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.info reports some basic information about a user-specified
     raster map	layer.	This map layer must exist in the user's
     current mapset search path.  Information about the	map's
     boundaries, resolution, projection, data type, category
     number, data base location	and mapset, and	history	are put
     into a table and written to standard output.  The types of
     information listed	can also be found in the /cats,	/cellhd,
     and /hist directories under the mapset in which the named
     map is stored.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the name	of a raster map	layer on the command
     line, using the form:

	  r.info map=name

     where name	is the name of a raster	map layer on which the
     user seeks	information.  The user can save	the tabular
     output to a file by using the UNIX	redirection mechanism
     (<);  for example,	the user might save a report on	the soils
     map layer in a file called	soil.rpt by typing:

	  r.info map=soils > soil.rpt

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.info on the command
     line, without program arguments.  In this case, the user
     will be prompted for the name of a	raster map layer using
     the standard GRASS	parser interface described in the manual
     entry for parser.	The user is asked whether he wishes to
     print the report and/or save it in	a file.	 If saved, the
     report is stored in a user-named file in the user's home
     directory.

     Below is the report produced by r.info for	the raster map
     geology in	the Spearfish sample data base.
