NAME
     i.composite - An imagery function that creates a color
     composite image from three	imagery	band files specified by
     the user.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.composite

DESCRIPTION
     i.composite creates a color composite image from three band
     files specified by	the user.  The user specifies the bands
     to	be used	by assigning a red, blue, and/or green color to
     each band.	 The resulting image is	a raster map layer of raw
     spectral data composed of the three bands chosen by the
     user.  The	color composite	can then be displayed, painted,
     or	manipulated as would any raster	map layer in GRASS.

     The first prompt asks the user for	the imagery group whose
     files are to be used.

     The following menu	is then	displayed:

     Please indicate which files to use	for red, green,	and blue
     colors.  You may leave any	color out.  You	may specify more
     than one color per	file.  However,	each color may only be
     specified once.  For example, to get a full color image,
     specify r,g,b for 3 different files.  To get a grey scale
     image, specify rgb	for a single file.

			  g__	 spot.2
			  r__	 spot.3
			  ___	 spotclass
			  ___	 spotreject

	 AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
		       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


     The user is then allowed to check the choice of bands:

		     Colors assigned as	follows:

		      RED:     spot.3@mapsetname
		      GREEN:   spot.2@mapsetname
		      BLUE:    spot.1@mapsetname

     saturation	levels (or shades) per primary color (blue,
     green, red)).  The	number of colors that can be displayed at
     one time on a color graphics monitor will depend on the
     graphics monitor being used.  For example,	if the graphics
     monitor can only display 512 colors at one	time, then the
     user must run the GRASS command d.colormode mode=fixed
     before displaying the raster map layer.  The colors that
     cannot be displayed will be assigned to the nearest
     displayable color,	and the	raster map layer will retain its
     relative color accuracy.  If the user is in float colormode,
     however, the raster map layer displayed on	the graphics
     monitor will not accurately reflect the map's real	color
     assignments.

     The user is then asked to name the	composite image	raster
     map layer.	 The percentage	completed is echoed to the screen
     and r.support files are created automatically.

NOTES
     The user should always check the geographic region	settings
     before running most imagery commands.  It is very easy for
     the boundaries of the geographic region to	be completely off
     the image.	 Before	running	i.composite, or	other imagery
     commands, the user	should probably	set the	geographic region
     to	match that of the raster map layers to be read.	 This can
     be	accomplished using option 4 of the g.region command.

     This program is interactive and requires no command line
     arguments.
