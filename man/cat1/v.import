NAME
     v.import  -  Converts ASCII Digital Line Graph (DLG) files,
     binary DLG	files, and ASCII vector	files into binary vector
     files and creates the needed vector support files.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.import

DESCRIPTION
     v.import is an interactive	program	which runs other vector
     import programs.  It allows you to	import DLG or ASCII
     vector files into GRASS vector format.  It	also runs
     v.support.	 No arguments are required on the command line.
     However, before running v.import, the user	should move the
     ASCII DLG files to	be imported into GRASS in a directory
     named dlg under the user's	current	GRASS mapset (i.e., under
     the directory known to GRASS as $LOCATION).  If a dlg
     directory does not	already	exist under the	user's current
     GRASS mapset, then	the user will have to make one using the
     UNIX mkdir	command, and then move the ASCII DLG files to be
     imported under that new dlg directory.

     This program performs all of the processes	that are needed
     to	convert	ASCII Digital Line Graph (DLG) files, binary DLG
     files, and	ASCII vector files into	binary vector files.  It
     also creates two support files, the dig_plus file and the
     dig_att file (only	created	when importing DLG files).  The
     dig_plus file contains topological	information obtained by
     analyzing the vector file.	 The dig_att file contains
     category (attribute) information files by the labeling
     function of the GRASS v.digit program.  All of the	above
     files must	be run through v.import	before they can	be used
     in	the v.digit program of GRASS 4.0.

IMPORT FILES
     After entering the	command	v.import, the user will	be asked
     for the type of file that is to be	imported and for which
     support files will	be created:

		   Import to GRASS Vector Format and Create Needed Support Files

	   1  -	  ASCII	DLG file to GRASS Vector Format
	   2  -	  Binary DLG file to GRASS Vector Format
	   3  -	  ASCII	VECTOR file to GRASS Vector Format
	   4  -	  Binary VECTOR	file to	GRASS Vector Format

     If	numbers	1-3 are	chosen,	v.import will respond with the
     current data base units (in feet or meters), and ask if the
     new vector	file is	in the correct units for the data base
     location.	If the new vector file is not in the correct
     units, v.import will not allow it to be placed in the

     current data base location.  For each data	base location,
     all map layers should have	the same units.	 If, for some
     reason, a map layer uses different	units than the rest of
     the map layers in the same	data base location, a new data
     base location will	have to	be created for it.


ASCII DLG File to GRASS	Vector Format:
     Convert an	ASCII DLG file (such as	those created in GRASS
     2.0) to a GRASS vector file and creates the dig_plus and
     dig_att support files. The	user is	asked two questions:

	  1. Determine if this map is composed of Area or Line information.
	     Do	you want to give precedence to Areas (opposed to Lines)? (y/n) [y]

	  NOTE:	Some machine-processed DLG files do not	make the
	  distinction between lines and	area edges.  For example,
	  in a roads map, where	the desired information	is line
	  data,	a downtown block surrounded by roads may be
	  processed as an area.	 Because of this, the user is
	  asked	to choose whether to give precedence to	areas or
	  lines.  If precedence	is given to lines, the user
	  should be aware that any lines that bound unlabeled
	  areas	in the DLG file	will be	stored as line data.  Any
	  unlabeled areas would	therefore be lost (this	is only	a
	  concern when areas are unlabeled, labeled area
	  information will be retained).  If precedence	is given
	  to areas, lines will be stored as boundaries to areas
	  that are unlabeled.

	  2. During the	building of the	Vector format:
	     Do	you want to snap nodes to other	nodes within a threshold (y/n) [n]

	  NOTE:	BE CAREFUL!  This threshold is calculated using
	  the scale of the original DLG	or dig file.  If the
	  threshold is too high, excessive snapping may	occur,
	  destroying the file.	In general, users seldom need to
	  snap nodes.  If snapping of nodes is desired,	the user
	  may want to run v.support separately.	v.support allows
	  the user to set the snapping threshold.

     This process is done in three phases:
     1.	The ASCII DLG file is converted	to a binary DLG	file.
     2.	The binary DLG file is converted to a binary Vector file,
     and the dig_att support file containing attribute (category)
     information is created.
     3.	The dig_plus support file is created by	analyzing the
     vector file for topological information.


Binary DLG File	to GRASS Vector	Format:
     Converts binary DLG files (such as	those created in GRASS



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			2

     2.0) to a vector file and creates the dig_plus and	dig_att
     support files. The	user is	asked whether precedence should
     be	given to Areas or Lines	and if nodes should be snapped to
     other nodes within	a calculated threshold.

     This process is done in two phases:
     1.	The binary dlg file is converted to a binary vector file,
     and the dig_att vector support file containing attribute
     information is created.
     2.	The dig_plus vector support file is created by analyzing
     the vector	file for topological information.


ASCII Vector file to GRASS Vector Format:
     Converts ASCII vector files (such as those	created	in GRASS
     2.0) into GRASS binary vector files, and creates the
     dig_plus vector support file.  Since a vector maintains the
     distinction between lines and area	edges, the user	is not
     asked to give precedence to either.  However, the user will
     be	asked if snapping from nodes to	other nodes within a
     calculated	threshold is desired.

     This process is done in two phases:
     1.	The ASCII vector file is converted to a	binary vector
     file, and the dig_plus vector support file	is created.
     2.	The dig_plus vector support file is created by analyzing
     the vector	file for topological information.


Binary Vector file to GRASS Vector Format:
     Creates the dig_plus vector support file.

     This process is done in one phase:
     1.	The dig_plus vector support file is created by analyzing
     the vector	file for topological information.

NOTES
     Before running v.import, the user should move the ASCII DLG
     files to be imported into GRASS in	a directory named dlg
     under the user's current GRASS mapset (i.e., under	the
     directory known to	GRASS as $LOCATION).  If a dlg directory
     does not already exist under the user's current GRASS
     mapset, then the user will	have to	make one using the UNIX
     mkdir command, and	then move the ASCII DLG	files to be
     imported under that new dlg directory.
