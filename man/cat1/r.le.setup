NAME
     r.le.setup (GRASS Raster Program)

GRASS VERSION
     4.x

SYNOPSIS
     r.le.setup

DESCRIPTION
     The first menu allows the user to define a rectangular
     sampling frame, select how sampling will be done (regions,
     sampling units, moving window), setup the limits for groups
     and classes, and change the color table.  Use the left mouse
     button to make your choice.

     Information about the structure of the landscape is obtained
     by overlaying a set of sampling areas on top of a specified
     part (the sampling frame of a map layer, and then
     calculating specific structural measures for the part of the
     map layer that corresponds to the area in each sampling
     area.

     To setup a sampling frame click on SAMPLING FRAME in the
     main menu.	 The program will ask "Will the sampling frame
     (total area within which sampling units are distributed) be
     the whole map? (y/n)  [y]"	 Just hit a carriage return to
     accept the default, which is to use the whole map.	 You do
     not need to setup a sampling frame if you want to use the
     whole map, as this is the default.	 To setup a different
     sampling frame type "n" in response to this question.  Then
     use the mouse and a rubber band box to outline a rectangular
     sampling frame on screen.	This box will be moved to the
     nearest row and column of the map.	 You will be asked last
     whether you want to "Refresh the screen before choosing more
     setup?"  If you don't like the sampling frame you just
     setup, answer yes to this question, then click on SAMPLING
     FRAME again to redo this part of the setup.  This sampling
     frame will be used in all subsequent setup procedures unless
     you change it.  You can change it at any time by simply
     clicking on SAMPLING FRAME again.

     A sampling area may be one of four things.	 First, it is
     possible to treat the entire map layer as the one (and only)
     sampling area.  Second, if the map layer can be divided into
     meaningful geographical regions, then it is possible to
     treat the regions themselves as sampling areas.  The third
     option is that the sampling areas may be sampling units of
     fixed shape and size (also called scale) that are placed
     within the map layer as a whole.  The fourth and final
     option is that the sampling area may be moved systematically
     across the map as a moving window.

     If regions are to be used as the sampling areas , then the
     user can use r.le.setup menu, and the user is asked to do
     the following:

     1.	 "ENTER THE NEW REGION MAP NAME:". Only a new raster map
     name is acceptable. The user
	 can type LIST to find out the existing raster map names
     in this location and mapset.

     2. "PLEASE OUTLINE REGION # 1". The user should move the
     mouse cursor into the graphic
	monitor window and use the mouse buttons as instructed:
     Left button: where am I.to display the current coordinates
     of the cursor.  Middle button: Mark start (next) point. to
     enter a vertex of the region boundary.  Right button: Finish
     region-connect to 1st point to close the region boundary by
     setting
	the last vertex to be equal to the first one.

     3. A "REGION OPTIONS:" menu is displayed and the user should
     use the mouse to select one of
	the options:

     "DRAW MORE": repeat the above process and setup another
     region.  "START OVER": abandon the previous setup and start
     all over again.  "DONE-SAVE": save the regions outlined so
     far and exit this procedure.  "QUIT-NO SAVE": quit the
     procedure without saving the regions.

     Once the "DONE-SAVE" option is selected, the new raster map
     of the sampling regions is generated. It is displayed on the
     monitor window for several seconds, the monitor window is
     refreshed, the main menu is displayed again, and the program
     is ready for other setup work.  Note that you cannot draw
     regions in areas outside the mask, if a mask is present (see
     r.mask command).

     The user can also use the GRASS r.digit.  Or, as mention
     above, an existing raster map can be used as a regions map.

     If sampling units are to be used as the sampling areas (Fig.
     2), then choose "SAMPLING UNITS" from the first r.le.setup
     subdirectory for an existing "units" file from a previous
     setup session and allows the user to rename this file (to
     save it) before proceeding.  The r.le.setup program will
     otherwise overwrite the "units" file.  Then the following
     choice is displayed followed by a series of other choices:

	  Which do you want to do?	    (1) Use the keyboard
     to enter sampling unit parameters	       (2) Draw the
     sampling units with the mouse
					Enter 1 or 2:

     When sampling units are defined using the keyboard, the user
     inputs the shape and size (scale) of the sampling units by
     specifying dimensions in pixels using the keyboard.  When
     sampling units are drawn with the mouse, the user clicks the
     mouse to define the sampling units in the GRASS monitor
     window, and then actually places the sampling units for each
     scale onto the map.  By placing the units with the mouse the
     user can directly determine the method of sampling unit
     distribution as well as the shape, size, and number of
     sampling units.

     If the choice is made to define sampling units using the
     keyboard, the following series of questions must be
     answered:

	  How many different SCALES do you want (1-15)?

     The user is asked to specify the number of scales that will
     be used.  The r.le programs allow the user to simultaneously
     sample the same map with the same measures using sampling
     areas of different sizes.	Currently there can be between 1
     and 15 scales that can be sampled simultaneously.
     Substantial output can be produced if many scales are used.

     Sampling units must be placed spatially into the landscape.
     There are five options for doing this :

     Random nonoverlapping Sampling units are placed in the
     landscape by randomly choosing numbers that specify the
     location of the upper left corner of each sampling unit,
     subject to the constraint that successive sampling units not
     overlap other sampling units or the edge of the landscape,
     and that they must be entirely within the area defined by
     the mask (see r.mask command) if one exists.

     Systematic contiguous Sampling units are placed side by side
     across the rows.  The user will be able to enter a row and
     column to indicate where the upper left corner of the
     systematic contiguous framework should be placed.	Rows are
     numbered from the top down beginning with row 1 of the
     sampling frame.  Columns are numbered from left to right,
     beginning with column 1 of the sampling frame.  A random
     starting location can be obtained by using a standard random
     number table to choose the starting row and column.  The
     r.le.setup program does not avoid placing the set of
     sampling units over areas outside the mask.  The user will
     have to make sure that sampling units do not extend outside
     the mask by choosing a particular starting row and column or
     by drawing a sampling frame before placing the set of
     sampling units.

r.le.setup <main>     GRASS Reference Manual	<main> r.le.setup



     Systematic noncontiguous The user must specify the starting
     row and column as in #2 above and the amount of spacing (in
     pixels) between sampling units.  Horizontal and vertical
     spacing are identical.  Sampling units are again placed side
     by side (but spaced) across the rows.  As in #2 the program
     does not avoid placing sampling units outside the masked
     area; the user will have to position the set of units to
     avoid areas outside the mask.

     Stratified random The strata are rectangular areas within
     which single sampling units are randomly located.	The user
     must first specify the starting row and column as in #2
     above.  Then the user must specify the number of strata in
     the horizontal and vertical directions.   As in #2 the
     program does not avoid placing sampling units outside the
     masked area; the user will have to position the set of units
     to avoid areas outside the mask.

     Centered over sites The user must specify the name of a
     sitefile containing point locations.  A single sampling unit
     is placed with its center over each site in the site file.
     This is a useful approach for determining the landscape
     structure around points, such as around the location of
     wildlife observations.

     The user is prompted to enter a ratio that defines the shape
     of the sampling units.  Sampling units may have any
     rectangular shape, including square as a special case of
     rectangular.  Rectangular shapes are specified by entering
     the ratio of columns/rows (horizontal dimension/vertical
     dimension) as a real number.  For example, to obtain a
     sampling unit 10 columns wide by 4 rows long specify the
     ratio as 2.5 (10/4).

	  Recommended maximum SIZE is m in x cell total area.

	  What size (in cells) for each sampling unit of scale n?

     The user is then given the recommended maximum possible size
     for a sampling unit (in pixels) and asked to input the size
     of sampling units at each scale.  Sampling units can be of
     any size, but the maximum size is the size of the landscape
     as a whole.  All the sampling units, that make up a single
     sampling scale, are the same size.	 After specifying the
     size, the program determines the nearest actual number of
     rows and columns, and hence size, that is closest to the
     requested size, given the shape requested earlier.

	  The nearest size is x cells wide X y cells high = xy
     cells	Is this size OK?  (y/n)	 [y]

	  Maximum NUMBER of units in scale n is p?	 What

r.le.setup <main>     GRASS Reference Manual	<main> r.le.setup



     NUMBER of sampling units do you want to try to use?

     The maximum number of units that can be placed over the map,
     given the shape and size of the units, is then given.  The
     user can then choose the number of sampling units to be used
     in the map layer.	It may not always be possible to choose
     the maximum number, depending upon the shape of the sampling
     units.  In the case of systematic contiguous and
     noncontiguous, the program will indicate how many units will
     fit across the columns and down the rows.	The user can then
     specify a particular layout (e.g., 6 units could be placed
     as 2 rows of 3 per row or as 3 rows of 2 per row).

	  Is this set of sampling units OK?  (y/n)  [y]

     Finally, the set of sampling units is displayed on the
     screen (e.g., Fig. 1) and the user is asked whether it is
     acceptable.  If the answer is no, then the user is asked if
     the screen should be refreshed before redisplaying the menu
     for "Methods of sampling unit distribution" so that the user
     can try the sampling unit setup again.

     The choice is made to define sampling units using the mouse,
     then the following menu for use with the mouse is displayed:

	  Outline the standard sampling unit of scale n.
     Left button:   Check unit size	    Middle button:   Move
     cursor	    Right button:    Lower right corner of unit
     here

     The user can then use the mouse and the rubber band box to
     outline the standard sampling unit.  Once it has been
     outlined, the number of columns and rows in the unit, the
     ratio of width/length and the size of the unit, in cells,
     will be displayed.	 After this first unit is outlined, then
     a new menu is displayed:

	  Outline more sampling units of scale n?	   Left
     button:	 Exit	      Middle button:   Not used
     Right button:  Lower right corner of next unit here

     The user can then place more units identical to the standard
     unit by simply clicking the right mouse button where the
     lower right corner of the unit should be placed.  The rest
     of the rubber band box can be ignored while placing
     additional units.	The program is set up so that units
     cannot be placed so they overlap one another, so they
     overlap the area outside the mask, or so they overlap the
     edge of the sampling frame.  Warning messages are issued for
     all three of these errors and a sampling unit is simply not
     placed.

     Using this procedure a rectangular "window" or single
     sampling area is moved systematically across the map to
     produce a new map (Fig. 2,3).  This sampling procedure can
     only be used with the measures that produce a single value
     or with a single class or group when measures produce
     distributions of values (Table 1).	 The first class or group
     specified when defining class or group limits (section
     2.3.2.) is used if distributional measures are chosen with
     the moving window sampling method.	 In this case, the user
     should manually edit the r.le.para/recl_tb file so that the
     desired group is listed as the first group in this file.

     Sampling begins with the upper left corner of the window
     placed over the upper left corner of the sampling frame.  It
     is strongly recommended that the user read the section on
     the GRASS mask (section 2.2.2) prior to setting up the
     moving window, as this mask can be used to speed up the
     moving window operation.  The value of the chosen measure is
     calculated for the window area.  This value is assigned to
     the location on the new map layer corresponding to the
     center pixel in the window if the window has odd (e.g. 3 X
     3) dimensions.  The value is assigned to the location on the
     new map layer corresponding to the first pixel below and to
     the right of the center if the window has even dimensions
     (e.g. 6 X 10).  If this pixel has the value "0," which means
     "no data" in GRASS, then this pixel is skipped and a value
     of "0" is assigned to the corresponding location in the new
     map.  The window is then moved to the right (across the row)
     by one pixel, and the process is repeated.	 At the end of
     the row, the window is moved down one pixel, and then back
     across the row.  This option produces a new map layer, whose
     dimensions are smaller by approximately (m-1)/2 rows and
     columns, where m is the number of rows or columns in the
     window.

     If the "MOVE-WINDOW" option in the main menu is selected,
     first the program checks for an existing "move_wind" file,
     in the r.le.para subdirectory, containing moving window
     specifications from a previous session.  The user is given
     the option to avoid overwriting this file by entering a new
     file name for the old "move_wind" file.  Users should be
     aware that moving window analyses are very slow, because a
     large number of sampling units are, in effect, used.  See
     the appendix on "Time needed to complete analyses with the
     r.le programs" for some ideas about how moving window size
     and sampling frame area affect the needed time to complete
     the analyses.

     distance methods m7-m9).

     Attribute groups and index classes are defined in a
     different way.  In the r.le programs attribute groups are
     defined as in the following example:

	  1, 3, 5, 7, 9 thru 21 = 1 (comment)	   31 thru 50 = 2
     (comment)	    end

     In this example, the existing categories 1, 3, 5, 7, {9, 10,
     ... 20, 21} are included in the new group 1, while {31, 32,
     33, ..., 49, 50} are included in the new group 2.	The
     characters in bold are the "key words" that are required in
     the definition.  Each line is called one "reclass rule".

     The GRASS reclass convention is adopted here with a little
     modification (see "r.reclass setup results.

     The r.le measurement index classes are defined by the lower
     limits of the classes, as in the following example:

	  0.0, 10.0, 50.0, 200.0, -999

     This means:

	  if v >= 0.0 and v < 10.0 then	 v belongs to index class
     1;	     if v >= 10.0 and v < 50.0 then  v belongs to index
     class 2;	   if v >= 50.0 and v < 200.0 then v belongs to
     index class 3;	 if v >= 200.0 then v belongs to index
     class 4;

     where v is the calculated index value and -999 marks the end
     of the index class definition. The measurement index can be
     the size index, one of the three shape indices, or one of
     the three distance indices.  The program is currently
     designed to allow no more than 25 attribute groups, 25 size
     classes, 25 shape index classes, and 25 distance index
     classes.  As an alternative, the user may want to
     permanently group certain attributes prior to entering the
     r.le programs.
