NAME
     v.in.dxf -	Converts files in DXF format to	ASCII or binary
     GRASS vector file format.
     (GRASS Vector Data	Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.in.dxf
     v.in.dxf help
     v.in.dxf [-a] dxf=name [lines=name[,name,...]]
     [labels=name[,name,...]] [prefix=name]

DESCRIPTION
     The v.in.dxf data conversion program generates GRASS dig,
     dig_ascii,	and dig_att files from a file in DXF format.
     Each layer	in the DXF input file is converted to a	separate
     dig (or dig_ascii)	layer.	For each DXF layer containing
     text, a dig_att file is also created.  These output files
     are placed	in the dig, dig_ascii, and dig_att directories
     under the user's current GRASS mapset.

     Output from this program is designed to be	used as	input to
     the program v.cadlabel.

     The v.in.dxf program will only recognize points, lines,
     polylines,	and text in the	DXF format, and	will translate
     these to GRASS vector format;  other types	of data	are
     ignored.


     Flag:

     -a		    Output an ASCII GRASS vector (dig_ascii) file
		    rather than	a binary GRASS vector (dig) file.


     Parameters:

     dxf=name	    Name of the	DXF input design file to be
		    converted to GRASS vector format.

lines=in_name:out_name[,in_name:out_name,...]
     lines=name[,name,...]  or
		    Name(s) of layer(s)	in the DXF input file
		    containing line data, and (optionally) the
		    name(s) to be assigned to the GRASS	vector
		    data (dig or dig_ascii) files output.
		    Default:  Convert each layer containing data
		    in the Idxf	file to	a GRASS	vector data (dig
		    or dig_ascii) file.

labels=in_name:out_name[,in_name:out_name,...]
     labels=name[,name,...]  or

		    Name(s) of layer(s)	in the DXF input file
		    containing text labels, and	(optionally) the
		    name(s) to be assigned to the GRASS	vector
		    attribute (dig_att)	files output.
		    Default:  Convert each layer containing text
		    labels in the dxf map to a GRASS vector
		    attribute (dig_att)	file.

     prefix=name    Prefix assigned to the dig or dig_ascii and
		    dig_att output file	names.

		    The	names of the GRASS vector (dig,
		    dig_ascii, and dig_att) files output are
		    constructed	as prefix.extension, where prefix
		    is the prefix name specified by the	user and
		    extension is the number of the DXF layer from
		    which the data were	obtained.  If the user
		    does not specify a prefix name, the	output
		    files take their prefix from the prefix of
		    the	input DXF map layer.  For example, for
		    the	DXF file named streams.dxf containing
		    line data on layer 15, the GRASS vector map
		    layer output would be named	streams.15.

EXAMPLES
     lines=15		 Outputs line data in DXF layer	15.

     lines=15,16	 Outputs line data in DXF layers 15 and
			 16.

     lines=ROADS,WATER	 Converts line data in DXF layers ROADS
			 and WATER.

     lines=15:16	 Outputs line data in DXF layer	15, and
			 places	it in the dig (or dig_ascii) file
			 for DXF layer 16.



     The below examples	are given for a	DXF design file	named
     cont.dxf containing contour lines and contour line	labels,
     in	which:

	  index	contour	lines are in DXF layer 9,
	  intermediate contour lines are in DXF	layer 11, and
	  index	labels and some	intermediate contour lines are in
	  DXF layer 12.

     v.in.dxf can be run with default values, as shown below:

	  v.in.dxf  dxf=cont.dxf

     Here, this	is equivalent to running the following command:

	  v.in.dxf  dxf=cont.dxf  lines=9,11,12	 labels=12

     Either of the above commands will produce three GRASS dig
     files (named cont.9, cont.11, and cont.12)	and one	dig_att
     file (named cont.12).

     In	our example, however, the cont.12 file contains
     intermediate contour lines	that the user would like to add
     to	the dig	file cont.11.  Our user	also wishes to use a
     different file prefix than	the default prefix cont.  The
     user therefore types the following	command:

	  v.in.dxf  dxf=cont.dxf  lines=9,11,12:11  labels=12
	  prefix=contour

     The above command will generate three dig files (named
     contour.9,	contour.11, contour.12), and will create one
     dig_att file containing text labels (called contour.12).  No
     contour lines will	appear in the dig_att file.

NOTES
     Output Filenames:
     The output	filename, prefix.extension, conforms with the
     GRASS limit of 14 characters.  The	entire prefix name is
     used, a '.' inserted, and as much of the extension	name is
     used as the 14 character limit will permit.  Excess
     characters	are truncated.	To minimize the	possibility of
     creating output files with	the same names (resulting in loss
     of	data from the DXF file), use the prefix	option to
     abbreviate	the DXF	file name.  This will leave the	majority
     of	characters available for differentiating between layer
     names.

     Translation:
     This data translation program does	not contain any	of the
     quality control functions available in v.digit that will
     prevent data in an	improper format	from being input to a
     GRASS data	base.  If present, DXF entities	are placed in
     output file(s) corresponding to the layers	on which they
     occurred in the DXF design	file input.

     Editing:
     If	the user asks v.in.dxf to output ASCII vector (dig_ascii)
     files, they must be converted to binary vector format before
     they are usable by	most GRASS vector commands.  The user can
     convert GRASS vector files	from ASCII to binary format by
     running such programs as v.support	or v.in.ascii.	After
     conversion	to binary format the vector files can be
     displayed (e.g., with d.vect);  however, the user must run
     v.support on the binary vector files before they can be

     edited in v.digit.	 The files output by v.in.dxf will
     preserve the data in whatever form	they exist in the DXF
     file.  This means that output files may contain unsnapped
     nodes, overshoots,	gaps, and replicated lines.  The data,
     and the file header information (including	the owner's name,
     map's name, date, and scale, and UTM zone)	for the	GRASS
     vector files output may require editing by	the user in
     v.digit.

     Attributes:
     The v.in.dxf program attaches attributes only to DXF text
     data that are converted to	GRASS vector data (such	as
     contour line labels).  Attributes are not attached	to
     converted DXF line	data.  For each	layer of text data in the
     DXF design	file, v.in.dxf generates a vector file consisting
     of	rectangular boxes (lines) that are drawn around	the DXF
     text data,	and uses the text values to create a GRASS
     attribute file for	the boxes.  The	vector and attribute
     files can then be used to label contour lines with	the
     v.cadlabel	program.
