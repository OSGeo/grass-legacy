NAME
     p.ppm - Reads portable pixmap (ppm) files created by PPM
     utilities.
     (GRASS Paint/Print	Program)

SYNOPSIS
     p.ppm
     p.ppm help
     p.ppm [-f]	[input=name]

DESCRIPTION
     This program, p.ppm, reads	a user-specified portable pixmap
     (ppm) file	and outputs it to the currently	selected printer
     (see p.select).  The input	ppm file should	be one that has
     been created using	the PPM	utilities developed by Jeff
     Poskanzer.	 These utilities can import various image formats
     (including	SUN raster, X Windows pixmaps, and others) into
     the PPM formats ppm (color	pixmaps), pgm (grey scale maps),
     and pbm (black and	white bit-maps).

     If	the image doesn't fit the output device, it won't get
     printed.  If you want the image printed (but clipped), use
     the p.ppm -f option, or scale the input using ppmscale, or
     rotate the	image using ppmrotate (if it will fit that way --
     otherwise you might have to scale it as well).  If	the image
     doesn't fit, p.ppm	will tell you what scaling value to enter
     to	ppmscale that will make	it fit.


EXAMPLES
     If	the user is running GRASS on a SUN machine, the	following
     command could be used to send a monitor screen image to the
     printer:

	  screendump | rasttoppm | p.ppm

     If	you are	running	suntools, the user might type:

	  sleep	10; screendump | rasttoppm | ppmrotate 90 | p.ppm

     The UNIX sleep command allows you time to arrange the frames
     before the	screen dump starts.  The ppmrotate is usually
     needed because the	SUN screens are	wider than they	are long
     (and wider	than 1024 pixels - which is the	width of most of
     our printers).

     If	you are	running	X, the user might type:

	  xwd |	xwdtoppm | ppmrotate 90	| p.ppm

NOTES
     This program only supports	the ppm	binary format (P6).

     Maximum color level is 255.  If the ppm file has more color
     levels, use ppmcscale to reduce the number	of colors.

     No	scaling	is done.  Use ppmscale to change image size.

     No	rotation is done.  Use ppmrotate to rotate the image.
