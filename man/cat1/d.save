d.save <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	    <main> d.save



NAME
     d.save - Creates a	list of	commands for recreating	screen
     graphics.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.save
     d.save help
     d.save [-ca] [frame=name[,name,...]]

DESCRIPTION
     When GRASS	display	(d.) commands are used to generate
     graphical images on the graphics monitor, some commands are
     noted in lists that the current graphics driver (see manual
     entry for d.mon) maintains.  This command,	d.save,	uses this
     information to create a shell script that can be used to
     recreate graphics in another frame	at another time.  The
     shell script is sent to standard output (the user's
     terminal).	 If you	wish to	save the shell script created by
     d.save, its output	should be redirected to	a file;	 for
     example:

	  d.save > script.out

     The user can run the program non-interactively by specifying
     flag settings and parameter values	on the command line.  If
     the user types d.save without specifying these program
     arguments,	the user will be prompted for inputs through the
     standard user interface described in the manual entry for
     parser.

COMMAND	LINE OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -c		       Shell script will contain only information
		       for regenerating	graphics from the active
		       (current) frame.	 Use of	this flag
		       overrides the frame option (below).

     -a		       Save information	needed to regenerate all
		       the frames on the graphics monitor.  The
		       shell script can	be used	to completely
		       reconstruct the contents	of the graphics
		       screen.

     Parameter:

     frame=name[,name,...]
		       Name(s) of those	display	frame(s) to be
		       saved.
		       Options:	 All available frames
		       Default:	 Active	frame
