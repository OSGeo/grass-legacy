NAME
     monitorcap	- Description of device	driver database	file
     format.

DESCRIPTION
     The d.mon command and all graphics	commands access	a device
     driver database stored in the file	$GISBASE/etc/monitorcap.
     This file contains	a line for each	graphics monitor on the
     system.  Each line	contains 6 fields separated by colons:


     name    the name by which the user	identifies the driver

     program the full pathname of the executable driver	or a
	     pathname relative to $GISBASE

     description
	     A short 4 or 5 word description of	the driver.

     fifos   full pathnames to the input and output fifos over
	     which the driver communicates with	the libraries

     tty     the name of the tty from which the	driver must be
	     started, or empty if there	is no such restriction

     msg     a message to print	to the user if an attempt is made
	     to	start the driver from the wrong	tty.

EXAMPLE
     The following is an example of a single monitor system.  The
     driver may	be started from	any terminal and uses /dev/fifo.a
     and /dev/fifo.b for communication with application	programs:

     x:driver/X:graphics monitor:/dev/fifo.a /dev/fifo.b::any terminal

     This example has 2	monitors on the	system,	using the same
     device driver.  Note that each has	a different name field
     and uses a	different pair of fifos.  Also,	each must be
     started on	a specific terminal:

     1:driver/X:monitor	1:/dev/fifo.1a /dev/fifo.1b:/dev/tty8:tty8
     2:driver/X:monitor	2:/dev/fifo.2a /dev/fifo.2b:/dev/tty10:tty10

NOTES
     Each line in this file must refer to a valid driver.  No
     comment lines are supported.  Also, no blank lines	are
     allowed.
