NAME
     r.flow - construction of slope curves (flowlines), flowpath
     lengths, and flowline densities from a raster DEM
     (GRASS Raster/Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.flow
     r.flow elevin=name [ aspin=name ] [ barin=name ]
	  [ -u3mMq ] [ skip=val ] [ bound=val ]
	  [ flout=name ] [ lgout=name ] [ dsout=name ]


DESCRIPTION
     r.flow generates flowlines using a combined raster-vector
     approach from an input elevation raster map elevin, and
     optionally an input aspect raster map aspin and/or an input
     barrier raster map barin.	There are three possible output
     maps which can be produced in any combination
     simultaneously:  a vector file flout of flowlines, a raster
     map lgout of flowpath lengths, and a raster map dsout of
     flowline densities.

     Aspect used for input must follow the same rules as aspect
     computed in other GRASS4.1 programs (see r.slope.aspect,
     s.surf.tps).

     Flowline output is given in a vector map flout.  The line
     segments of flowline vectors have endpoints on a grid formed
     by drawing imaginary lines through the centers of the cells
     in the elevation map.  Flowlines are generated from each
     cell downhill by default; they can be generated uphill using
     the flag -u.  A flowline stops if its next segment would
     reverse the direction of flow (from up to down or vice-
     versa), cross a barrier, or arrive at a cell with undefined
     elevation or aspect.  Another option, skip=val, indicates
     that only the flowlines from every valth cell are to be
     included in flout.	 The default skip is max(1, <rows in
     elevin>/50, <cols in elevin>/50).	A high skip usually
     speeds up processing time and often improves the readability
     of a visualization of flout.


     Flowpath length output is given in a raster map lgout.  The
     value in each grid cell is the sum of the planar lengths of
     all segments of the flowline generated from that cell.  If
     the flag -z is given, elevation is taken into account in
     calculating the length of each segment.


     Flowline density output is given in a raster map dsout.  The
     value in each grid cell is the number of flowlines in the
     entire map which have segment endpoints within that cell.

OPTIONS
     If the user specifies program arguments and flag settings on
     the command line, the program will immediately begin
     working.  Alternatively, the user can simply type r.flow on
     the command line and the program will ask for parameter
     values and flag settings interactively, using the standard
     GRASS parser interface.


     Flags:

     -u		       Generate flowlines uphill (default
		       generates flowlines downhill).


     -3		       Compute three-dimensional lengths (default
		       is two-dimensional).


     -m		       Use less memory and compute aspect at each
		       cell on the fly.	 This option incurs a
		       performance penalty.  If this flag is
		       given, the aspect input map (if any) will
		       be ignored.


     -M		       Use a fixed size memory and utilize page-
		       swapping to handle large input files.
		       This option incurs a severe performance
		       penalty but is the only way to handle
		       arbitrarily-large data files.  If this
		       flag is given, the -m flag will be
		       ignored.


     -q		       Quiet operation.	 Do not print diagnostic
		       messages indicating progress.


     Parameters:


     elevin=name       Use the existing raster file name with
		       elevations as input (required).


     aspin=name	       Use the existing raster file name with
		       aspects as input.


     barin=name	       Use the existing raster file name with
		       non-zero values representing barriers as

		       input.


     skip=val	       Set the number of cells between flowlines
		       in the flout output map to val.


     bound=val	       Set the maximum number of segments of each
		       flowline to val (default is the maximum
		       possible).


     flout=name	       Output coordinates of flowlines to a
		       vector file named name.


     lgout=name	       Output flowpath length values to a raster
		       file named name.


     dsout=name	       Output flowline density values to a raster
		       file named name.


NOTES
     For best results, use input elevation maps with high
     precision units (e.g., centimeters) so that flowlines do not
     terminate prematurely in flat areas.

     To prevent the creation of tiny flowline segments with
     imperceivable changes in elevation, an endpoint which would
     land very close to the center of a grid cell is quantized to
     the exact center of that cell.  The maximum distance between
     the intercepts along each axis of a single diagonal segment
     and another segment of 1/2 degree different aspect is taken
     to be "very close" for that axis.	Note that this distance
     (the so-called "quantization error") is about 1-2% of the
     resolution on maps with square cells.

     The values in length maps computed using the -u flag
     represent the distances from each cell to an upland flat or
     singular point.  Such distances are useful in water erosion
     modeling for computation of the LS factor in the standard
     form of USLE.  Uphill flowlines tend to merge on ridge
     lines; by redirecting the order of the flowline points in
     the output vector map, dispersed waterflow can be simulated.
     The density map can be used for the extraction of ridge
     lines.

     Computing the flowlines downhill simulates the actual flow
     (also known as the raindrop method).  These flowlines tend
     to merge in valleys; they can be used for localization of

     areas with waterflow accumulation and for the extraction of
     valley lines.  The downslope flowline density multiplied by
     the resolution is equal to the upslope contributing area,
     defined as the area from which water flows into a given
     cell.  This area is a measure of potential water flux and
     can be used in the modeling of water erosion for the
     computation of the unit stream power based LS factor.

     The program has been designed for modeling erosion on
     hillslopes and has rather strict conditions for ending
     flowlines.	 It is therefore not very suitable for the
     extraction of stream networks or delineation of watersheds
     unless a DEM without pits or flat areas is available.

     If r.flow is invoked with the -M flag, it will create up to
     three segment files; concurrently running copies of r.flow
     using this flag will compete for the same three files.
     Until concurrency control is standardized in GRASS it is
     suggested that all concurrently running copies of r.flow
     using the -M flag have distinct input and output files.

     ERROR: r.flow: resolution too unbalanced (val x val)
	  The difference in length between the two axes of a grid
	  cell is so great that quantization error is larger than
	  one of the dimensions.  Resample the map and try again.
