NAME
     v.import -	SCS user interface to GRASS import programs.
     (SCS GRASS	Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.import
     v.import help

DESCRIPTION
     This program performs all of the processes	that are needed
     to	convert	ASCII DLG files, binary	DLG files, ASCII SCS-GEF
     files, ASCII ARC Ungenerate files,	ASCII DXF files, and
     ASCII vector files	into binary vector files.  It also
     creates support files, the	dig_plus file and the dig_att
     file (only	created	when importing DLG, SCS-GEF, or	ARC
     files). The dig_plus file contains	topological information
     obtained by analyzing the vector file.  The dig_att file
     contains attribute	information 'stripped' from the	DLG file
     or	SCS-GEF	text data.  This dig_att file is created for
     vector files by the labeling function of the GRASS	v.digit
     program.

     IMPORT FILES
     After entering the	command	 v.import, the user will be asked
     which type	of file	to import and create support files for:

     Import to GRASS Vector Format and Creates Needed Support Files
	  1  -	 ASCII DLG file	 to GRASS Vector Format
	  2  -	 Binary	DLG file to GRASS Vector Format
	  3  -	 ASCII DIGIT file  to GRASS Vector Format
	  4  -	 Binary	DIGIT file to GRASS Vector Format
	  5  -	 ASCII SCS-GEF file to GRASS Vector Format
	  6  -	 ASCII ARC/INFO	file to	GRASS Vector Format
	  7  -	 ASCII DXF file	to GRASS Vector	Format
	  8  -	 ASCII TIGER file to GRASS Vector Format

	  If numbers 1-3 or 5-8	are chosen, v.import will respond
	  with the current database units (in feet or meters),
	  and ask if the new vector file is in the correct units
	  for the database location.  If the new vector	file is
	  not in the correct units, v.import will not allow it to
	  be placed in the current database location.  For each
	  database location, all data layer should have	the same
	  units.  If, for some reason, a data layer has	different
	  units	than the rest of the data layers in the	same
	  database, a new database location will have to be
	  created for it.

     ASCII DLG File to GRASS Vector
     Converts ASCII DLG	files (such as those created in	GRASS) to
     a vector file and creates the dig_plus and	dig_att	support
     files.  The user is asked several questions:



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			1






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



	  1. The name of the DLG data file.

	  NOTE:	It should be available in the $LOCATION/dlg
	  directory.  If the DLG data has an attribute flat file,
	  it should also be in $LOCATION/dlg.

	  2. Determine if this map is composed of Area or Line
	  information.

	  NOTE:	Some machine-processed DLG files do not	make the
	  distinction between lines and	area edges.  For example,
	  in a roads map, where	the desired information	is line
	  data,	a downtown block surrounded by roads may be
	  processed as an area.	 Because of this, the user is
	  asked	to choose whether to give precedence to	areas or
	  lines.  If precedence	is given to lines, the user
	  should be aware that any lines that bound unlabeled
	  areas	in the DLG file	will be	stored as line data.  Any
	  unlabeled areas would	therefore be lost (this	is only	a
	  concern when areas are unlabeled, labeled area
	  information will be retained).  If precedence	is given
	  to areas, lines will be stored as boundaries to areas
	  that are unlabeled.

	  3. Determine if you want to snap nodes to other nodes
	  within a threshold.

	  NOTE:	 BE CAREFUL!!!	This threshold is calculated
	  using	the scale of the original DLG or v.digit file.
	  If the threshold is too high,	excessive snapping may
	  occur, destroying the	file.  In general, users seldom
	  need to snap nodes.  If snapping of nodes is desired,
	  the user may want to run v.support separately.
	  v.support allows the user to set the snapping
	  threshold.

	  4.  Does the DLG data	contain	GRASS category codes?

	  NOTE:	 Most non-GRASS	computer systems will not be able
	  to provide the necessary codes.  The flat attribute
	  file serves this purpose.  If	the answer to this
	  question is NO:

	  1) Enter a SUBJECT MATTER file name.
	  A subject file will be used to assign	GRASS category
	  codes	to the DLG data.  It is	structured the same as a
	  dig_cats category file.  It is suggested that	a SUBJ
	  directory be created in the GRASS location and a file
	  containing all DLG attribute text labels by category be
	  created.  This will be required to provide consistency
	  across several maps (quads) within one location.  The
	  user may use the vi text editor or the SCS macro



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			2






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



	  make_subject to create it.

	  2) Enter an ATTRIBUTE	file name.
	  This is the name of the flat file which will accompany
	  a DLG	from a non-GRASS system.  This file contains all
	  of the DLG area numbers with a corresponding text
	  label.

	  3) Is	the DLG	data from an ARC/INFO system.
	  ARC/INFO DLG data is handled in a slightly different
	  manner.

	  4) Does The DLG contain a Universe Polygon.
	  Some DLG files may or	may NOT	have this and processing
	  will be required to handle each case differently.

	  This process is done in three	phases:

	  1. If	the DLG	does NOT contain category codes, then a
	  category file	from the attribute file	is created.  Then
	  the ASCII dlg	file is	converted to a binary dlg file.

	  - OR -

	  If the DLG does contain category codes, then the ASCII
	  DLG file is converted	to a binary DLG	file.

	  2. The binary	dlg file is converted to a binary vector
	  file,	and the	dig_att	support	file containing	attribute
	  information is created.

	  3. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing
	  the vector file for topological information.

     Binary DLG	File to	GRASS Vector
     Converts binary DLG files (which should be	in the bdlg
     directory)	to a vector file and creates the dig_plus and
     dig_att support files.  The user is asked whether precedence
     should be given to	Areas or Lines and if nodes should be
     snapped to	other nodes within a calculated	threshold.

	  This process is done in two phases:

	  1. The binary	DLG (bdlg) file	is converted to	a binary
	  vector file, and the dig_att support file containing
	  attribute information	is created.

	  2. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing
	  the vector file for topological information.

     ASCII Vector File into GRASS Vector
     Converts ASCII v.digit files (which are located in	dig_ascii



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			3






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



     directory)	into binary vector files and creates the dig_plus
     support file.  Since a vector file	keeps the distinction
     between lines and area edges, the user is not asked to give
     precedence	to either.  However, the user will be asked if
     the user wants to snap from nodes to other	nodes within a
     calculated	threshold.

	  This process is done in two phases:

	  1. The ASCII vector file is converted	to a binary
	  vector file, and the dig_plus	support	file is	created.

	  2. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing
	  the vector file for topological information.

     Binary Vector File	to GRASS Vector
     Creates the dig_plus support file.

	  This process is done in one phase:

	  1. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing
	  the vector file for topological information.

     Acsii SCS-GEF File	to GRASS Vector
     Creates the dig_plus, dig_att, and	dig_cats support files.
     Creates a registration coordinates	file.

	  Allows a user	to create a GRASS vector file from a
	  SCS-GEF format ASCII file.

	  1.  The program will first request the name of the
	  SCS-GEF file to be read in, it expects to find the data
	  in the $LOCATION/gef directory.

	  2.  The program will then request the	name of	a GRASS
	  vector file.

	  3.  The program will then request the	name of	a SUBJECT
	  file.	 A subject file	will be	used to	assign GRASS
	  category codes to the	SCS-GEF	data.  It is structured
	  the same as a	dig_cats category file.	 It is suggested
	  that a SUBJ directory	be created in the GRASS	location
	  and a	file containing	all SCS-GEF text labels	by
	  category be created.	This will be required to provide
	  consistency across several mapsets (quads) within one
	  location.  The user may use the vi text editor or the
	  SCS macro make_subject to create it.

	  4.  The program will then read the SCS-GEF header
	  information, interactively present information that was
	  available, and request additional data of the	user.
	  These	questions are :



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			4






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



		     Name of their organization. (from SCS-GEF)
		     Digitized Date.		 (from SCS-GEF)
		     Map Name.			 (from SCS-GEF)
		     Map Location.		 (from SCS-GEF)
		     Other Information.		 (from SCS-GEF)
		     State FIPS	code.
		     County FIPS code.
		     Present GEF Coord.	System (table, stplane,	ll, utm).
		     Coord. System Desired (utm, stplane, ll, albers).

	  The program will then	actively read the SCS-GEF data
	  file and process it.

	  Note:	scripts	contains SCS macro make_1_gef.	This
	  macro	makes one file out of the three	(3) files found
	  in SCS-GEF ( see SCS-GEF technical specifications for
	  more information).  The macro	must be	run on each data
	  set BEFORE v.import.

     ASCII ARC/INFO Ungenerate Format Files to GRASS Vector
     Creates the dig_plus, dig_att, and	dig_cats support files.
     The program will prompt you to enter the names of ARC/INFO
     files to be imported to GRASS.  ARC/INFO vector files to be
     imported into GRASS must be exported from ARC/INFO	using the
     ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.  ARC/INFO vector files which
     are to are	to be imported to GRASS, must be either	line or
     polygon coverages.	 They must also	be placed in a
     $LOCATION/arc directory.  The section of the ARC/INFO manual
     that cover	the Ungenerate command describes how to	export
     line and polygon coverages.

	  A polygon coverage is	represented by three files:

	  1) a lines file, which contains coordiates of	all the
	  area edge lines;
	  2) label-point file, which contains coordintes of
	  label-points each with a unique label-point ID number.
	  There	is one label-point for each polygon defined in
	  the lines file; and
	  3) a label-text file,	which associates label-point ID
	  number with a	category value and attribute text.

	  A line coverage is represented by two	files:

	  1) a lines file, which contains coordinates of of the
	  lines, each with a line-ID number; and
	  2) a label-text file,	which associates each line-ID
	  number with a	category value and attribute text.

	  The program will start out by	asking you which type of
	  coverage is to be imported, as follows:




GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			5






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



	  IMPORTING A POLYGON COVERAGE
	  The prompts that will	be presented for coverage type
	  "polygon."
		       COVERAGE	TYPE
		       Enter "polygon" or "line"
		       Hit RETURN to cancel request
		       >
		  Answer "polygon"

		       NEATLINE
		       Do you want a neatline ?
		       Enter "yes" or "no"
		       >
		  If you answer	yes then vectors representing
	       a box around the	data will be inserted into
	       the resulting GRASS vector file,	otherwise
	       no neatline will	be created.

     Next the program will prompt for the name of the lines-file
     containing	the arc	coodinates of the polygons.  The lines-
     file is created with the Ungenerate LINES option and is the
     same format as the	map_name.pol file created by the program.
     The following is the prompt:
		   LINES FILENAME
		  Enter	name of	the file created with the LINES
		  option of the	ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
		  Hit RETURN to	cancel request
		  >
     The next prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the
     name of the label-points file.  The label-points files is
     created with the Ungenerate POINTS	option and is the same
     format as the mapname.lab file created by the export.vect
     ARC program.  The following is the	prompt:
		  LABEL-POINTS FILENAME
		 Enter name of file created with the POINTS
		 option	of the ARC/INFO	Ungenerate command.
		 Hit RETURN if there is	no such	file
		 >
     The last prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the
     name of the label-text file.  This	file associates	each
     label-point ID number with	a text string and is the same
     format as the mapname.txt file created by the export.vect
     ARC program.  The following is the	prompt:
		  LABEL-TEXT FILENAME
		 Enter the name	of a file that associates
		 label-point ID	numbers	with text label	strings
		 Hit RETURN if there is	no such	file
		 >
     The program will then scan	the label-text file to determine
     how many columns are in the file and to determine which
     column should be used as the label-point ID number	column.
     The program will then tell	you how	many lines and columns



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			6






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



     are in the	label-text file.  Next you will	be prompted to
     enter the number of the column to be used for GRASS category
     values.  The category number column MUST contain only
     integers.
		   Enter the number of the column that is to be	used
		   for GRASS category values:

     and the number the	column to be used for GRASS attribute
     text.  The	attribute text column can contain a floating
     point number, an integer, or a word.
		   Enter the number of the column that should be used
		   for GRASS attribute text:

     Once you enter the	category and attribute column numbers,
     the program will begin conversion of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate
     files into	GRASS vector format.

     IMPORTING A LINE COVERAGE
     First, you	are prompted for the name of the lines-file
     containing	the arc	coordinates of the lines.  The lines-file
     is	created	with the Ungenerate LINES option and is	the same
     format as the mapname.lin file created by the export.vect
     ARC program.
		    LINES FILENAME
		   Enter name of the file created with the lines
		   option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
		   Hit RETURN to cancel	request
		   >
     The last prompt for coverage type "line" asks for the name
     of	the label-text file.  This file	associates each	line-ID
     number with a text	string and is the same format as the
     mapname.txt file created by the export.vect ARC program.
		    LABEL-TEXT FILENAMES
		   Enter name of file associating line ID numbers
		   numbers with	label text.
		   Hit RETURN if there is no such file
		   >
     The program will scan the label-text file to determine how
     many columns are in the file and will then	tell you how many
     columns are in the	label-text.  Next you will be prompted to
     enter the number of the column to be used for line-ID
     numbers.
		   Enter the number of the column that is to be	used
		   for line-ID numbers:

     Next you will be prompted to enter	the number of the column
     to	be used	for GRASS category values.  The	category number
     column MUST contain only integers.
		   Enter the number of the column that is to be	used
		   for GRASS category values:





GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			7






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



     and the number of the column to be	used for GRASS attribute
     text.  The	attribute text column can contain a floating
     point number, an integer, or a word.
		   Enter the number of the column that should be used as
		   for GRASS attribute text:

     Once you enter the	column numbers the program will	begin
     conversion	of the ARC/INFO	Ungenerate files into GRASS
     vector format.

     DATA FILE FORMATS
     Following are examples of the data	files discussed	in the
     section above.

	  LINES	FILE, also known as xxx.lin or xxx.pol file.
	  This type of file can	be created in ARC/INFO by using
	  the lines subcommand of the Ungenerate command.  Each
	  line,	or arc,	is defined by a	line-ID	number,	followed
	  by a list of at least	two easting and	northing
	  coordinate pairs, followed by	a line with the	word
	  "END".  The file is terminated with the word "END".
	  The line-ID number is	only important for line
	  coverages.  For a line coverage, the line-ID number is
	  the number that associates each line with its	attribute
	  data.

	  NOTES	When importing a polygon coverage, the program
	  finds	the label-point	ID in a	label-text file	by
	  looking for the second column	in the file that contains
	  a "1"	on line	1, and a "2" on	line 2.
	  If you are missing a label-points or a label-text file
	  you can still	import ARC/INFO	data (but none of your
	  lines	or areas will be labelled).

     ASCII DXF Format Files to GRASS Vector
     Creates the dig_plus, dig_att, and	dig_cats support files.

     ASCII TIGER Format	Files to GRASS Vector
     This program imports Census line features from TIGER records
     type1 and type2 into GRASS	vector format.	Both pre-Census
     and post-Census data formats can be used.	Specific Census
     Feature Class Codes (CFCC)	can be extracted completely or in
     various combinations.  These codes	are described in the
     TIGER/line	Census Files 1990 documemtation	available from
     the Bureau	of the Census.	An additional feature code
     consisting	of the three letters "BOU" may also be specified
     to	extract	a county boundary.  Condensed Record 1 files may
     be	imported with the -c flag.  These files	should be



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			9






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



     identified	with a trailing	"x" character on the filename.
     The TIGER files must in sorted order before being used.
     This can be done by using the following command:
	  sort TGR12113.F21 -o t12113.1
	  sort TGR12113.F22 -o t12113.2
     For consistency the sorted	file should be written as above.
     It	should consist of a 't'	followed by the	State and County
     FIPS code,	then a '.' and then a value to identify	the
     record number.
