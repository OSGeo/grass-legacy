NAME
     ISMcont2dig - Converts a binary ISM contour data file to a
     binary GRASS vector (dig) file.
     (GRASS Vector Data	Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     ISMcont2dig
     ISMcont2dig help
     ISMcont2dig input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts a binary ISM	contour	data file into a
     binary GRASS vector (dig) file.  ISMcont2dig also creates a
     dig_att file containing the label information from	the ISM
     contour file.  However, the user must run v.support (or
     v.import option 4)	on the output file created by ISMcont2dig
     to	create a dig_plus file containing the file topology,
     before using the output file in v.digit.

COMMAND	LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of binary ISM contour data input
		       file.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the binary GRASS
		       vector files created.

     If	the user simply	types ISMcont2dig without specifying
     parameter values on the command line, the program will
     prompt the	user to	enter these.

NOTES
     To	create a contour file from ISM for use by ISMcont2dig,
     turn on option 7 (contour output file) under CONTOUR/BASE
     MAP OPTIONS.  To achieve better contour resolution, also
     change options 12 and 13 (minimum separation) under this
     same menu to some minimum number such as .00001.  The ISM
     user may wish to save these options as an ISM options file.
     Plot the map as usual.  At	run time, ISM will prompt the
     user for a	filename and ask whether the contour output
     format should be binary (default) or ASCII.  Only BINARY
     contour files may be used by ISMcont2dig.
