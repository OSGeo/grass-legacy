.SH NAME
\fIi.class\fR \- An imagery function that generates spectral signatures
for an image by allowing the user to outline regions of interest.
The resulting signature file can be used as input for \fIi.maxlik\fR or
as a seed signature file for \fIi.cluster\fR.
.br
\fI(GRASS Image Processing Program)\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B i.class
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I i.class
performs the first pass in the GRASS two-pass supervised image
classification process;
the GRASS program \fIi.maxlik\fR executes the second pass.
Both programs must be run to generate a classified map in GRASS
raster format.

\fIi.class\fR is an interactive program that allows the user to outline
a region on the screen and calculate the spectral signature based on the
cells that are within that region.  During this process the user will be
shown a histogram of the region for each image band.  The user can also
display the cells of the image bands which fall within a user-specified
number of standard deviations from the means in the spectral signature.
By doing this, the user can see how much of the image
is likely to be put into the class associated with the current signature.

The spectral signatures that result are composed of region means
and covariance matrices.  These region means and covariance matrices
are used in the second pass (\fIi.maxlik\fR) to classify the image.

Alternatively, the spectral signatures generated by \fIi.class\fR can
be used for seed means for the clusters in the \fIi.cluster\fR program.
.SH USER INPUTS
The first screen in the program \fIi.class\fR asks the user for the
imagery \fIgroup\fR and \fIsubgroup\fR to be analyzed:

AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
(OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)
\fR

The \fIgroup\fR should contain the imagery bands that the user wishes
to classify.  The \fIsubgroup\fR is a subset of this group.
The user must create a group and a subgroup by running the GRASS program
\fIi.group\fR before running \fIi.class\fR.  The subgroup should contain
only the image bands that the user wishes to classify.
Note that this subgroup must contain more than one band.

After the first screen, the program asks the user for the name of the
resulting signature file.  The signature file is both the output file for
\fIi.class\fR and the required input file for the GRASS
program \fIi.maxlik\fR.  It contains the region means and
covariance matrices that are used to classify an image in \fIi.maxlik\fR.

After entering the resulting signature file name, the user is asked to
enter the name of a seed signature file.  This is optional.
A "seed" signature file is a previously created signature file.
Such a seed signature file may be the result of an earlier
run of \fIi.class\fR.  The seed signature file is copied into the new
resulting signature file before any new signatures are added
by \fIi.class\fR.  In this way, you can collect the work from several
sessions with \fIi.class\fR into one signature file.
.LP
Next, the user is asked to enter the name of the raster map to be
displayed during the process of outlining regions.  Typically, the
user will want to enter the name of a
color composite previously created by \fIi.composite\fR.
However, the user can
enter the name of any existing raster map.  This leaves the potential for
using a raster map not directly derived from the image as a backdrop on
which the user can outline the classes of interest.
.LP
At this point the \fIi.class\fR graphics screen will be drawn on the
graphics monitor and the user will be directed to use the mouse.
From this point on the user will primarily work with the mouse,
selecting options from the menus and outlining regions on the screen.
The only time that the user will need to return to the text terminal
is to enter names for the signatures created.

The display frame layout that \fIi.class\fR uses is represented below
for reference.

.FI
.SH THE MENUS
All of the menus in the \fIi.class\fR program are displayed across
the bottom of the graphics monitor in the Menu Frame.
To select an option from one of these menus, simply place the cursor
over your selection and press any button on the mouse.
Each of the menus is discussed in the following paragraphs.
.SH The Command Menu
The Command Menu includes the following selections:
.LP
\fIZoom\fR - This command allows the user to outline a rectangular
region in either the Map or Zoom Display Frames and the region is
displayed, magnified, to fit in the Zoom Display Frame.  
A red rectangle is drawn in the Map Display Frame,
indicating what area the Zoom Display Frame shows.

To outline the rectangular region simply use any mouse button to anchor
the first corner of the border and then use any button to choose the
other corner.

\fIDefine region\fR - This selection takes the user to the Region
Menu.  This menu includes the options that allow the user to outline
a region of interest on the displayed raster map.

\fIRedisplay map\fR - This selection takes the user to the Redisplay
Menu.  The Redisplay Menu allows the user to redraw map display
frames.

\fIAnalyze region\fR - This selection starts the process of analyzing
the currently defined region.  A histogram of the defined
region will be displayed for each band.  On the histogram for each band,
the mean, standard deviation, minimum cell value and maximum cell
value are marked.  The histograms are automatically scaled in an attempt to
fit the data into the space available, but it is possible that all of
the data will not fit.  In this case, as much of the data as possible,
centered around the mean, will be displayed.  After the histograms are
displayed, the user will be given the Signature Menu.

\fIQuit\fR - The user should make this selection 
to end the session with \fIi.class\fR.
.SH The Region Menu
The Region Menu contains the following selections:

\fIErase region\fR - This selection erases any currently defined
region.

\fIDraw region\fR - This selection allows the user to use the mouse to
draw a region on either the Map or Zoom Display Frame.  An
explanation of which mouse buttons to use is displayed in the Menu
Frame.  The user does not need to try to complete the region boundary.  The
last line of the region will be added when the user selects the
Complete region option on the Region Menu.

\fIRestore last region\fR - This selection restores the last region
that was drawn.  After a region is completed, it will be saved to be
restored later.  Only one previous region is saved.

\fIComplete region\fR - This selection completes the region that is
currently being drawn.  As noted above, it saves the complete
region to be restored later, if needed.  Once the user has made a
complete region, it can be analyzed with the Analyze Region
selection on the Command Menu.

\fIDone\fR - Use this selection to return to the Command Menu.
.SH The Redisplay Map Menu
The Redisplay Map Menu has the following selections, which are useful
to redraw the raster maps displayed in the Map and Zoom Display Frames.

\fIMap geographic region\fR - This selection causes the raster map in the Map
Display Frame to be redrawn.

\fIZoom region\fR - This selection causes the Zoom Display Frame to
be redrawn.

\fIBoth\fR - This selection causes both the Map and Zoom Display
Frames to be redrawn.

\fICancel\fR - Use this selection if you do not want to redisplay
either of the above regions.  The user will be returned to the Command
Menu.
.SH The Analyze Region Menu
The Analyze Region Menu contains the Signature Menu, which allows the user
to set the number of standard deviations and the display color,
and then to display (as an overlay) the cells that match the signature
within the number of standard deviations specified.  Note that once
the matching cells are displayed, the Map Display Frame must be redisplayed
to see only the original raster map again.  The following selections are available
on the Signature Menu:

\fISet std dev's\fR - This selection allows the user to set the number
of standard deviations from the mean for the maximum and minimum
range.  The maximum and minimum range is used when finding the cells
that "match" the signature.  The user is presented with a menu of
typical choices and an "Other" option.  If the 
"Other" option is selected, enter the number of standard
deviations from the keyboard on the text terminal.  Otherwise, the
selected option will be used.  When the number of standard deviations
is set, the histograms for each band will be redrawn with the maximum
and minimum range marked.

Note that the number in parentheses on this
selection is the current number of standard deviations.

\fISet color\fR - This selection allows the user to set the color for
the display of cells that "match" the current signature.  The user is
presented with a menu of color choices.  The color selected will be
used when the Display Matches Menu selection is made.

Note that the color in parentheses on this selection is the current
color for display.

\fIDisplay matches\fR - This selection displays the cells that "match"
the current signature in the current color.  A cell "matches" the
current signature if the cell value in each band is between the
minimum range and maximum range for that band defined by the number of
standard deviations currently set.

\fIDone\fR - When this selection is chosen, the user will be asked
whether or not he/she would like to save the current signature.  If the
user answers with the "Yes" selection, he/she will be asked to enter
a description for the resultant signature file on the text terminal keyboard.
The saved signature file description will be used by \fIi.maxlik\fR to name the category
that is created from the current signature.  After either a "No" answer or the
signature description is entered, the user is returned to the Command Menu.
.SH NOTES
\fIi.class\fR uses the current MASK to generate the overlay for cells
that match a signature.  As a result, if a MASK already exists it will be removed
during the execution of this program.

The cell values in the image bands cannot fall outside of the range of 0
to 255.  \fIi.class\fR will report an error if they do.

\fIi.class\fR, like some of the other imagery programs, does not use the
standard GRASS display frames.  After running \fIi.class\fR, you will need to
create a display frame (e.g., using \fId.frame\fR or \fId.erase\fR)
before you can use most of the GRASS display (d.) commands.

.I i.group
must be run before \fIi.class\fR to create an imagery group and a subgroup
containing the image bands to be classified.

The user can perform a supervised image classification by running \fIi.class\fR
followed by \fIi.maxlik\fR.  The user can perform an unsupervised classification
by running \fIi.cluster\fR followed by \fIi.maxlik\fR.

\fIi.class\fR is interactive and requires no command line arguments.
The user must be running a graphics display monitor (see \fId.mon\fR)
to run this program.
