\fBp.map\fR [\fBinput\*=\fIname\fR] [\fBscale\*=\fImapscale\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I p.map
produces hardcopy color map products on your system's color output
device.  Output can include a raster map, any number of vector overlays,
site data, text labels, and other spatial data.

This program has 2 distincts modes of operation.  The command-line
mode requires the user to prepare a file of mapping instructions describing
the various spatial and textual information to be printed prior to running
\fIp.map\fR.
The interactive mode (i.e., no command-line arguments) will prompt the
user for items to be mapped and does not require the user
to prepare a file of instructions.

The command-line parameters are:
.IP \fBinput\*=\fIname\fR 18
File containing mapping instructions.
(or enter \fBinput\*=-\fR to enter from keyboard).
These instructions are described in detail below.
.IP \fBscale\*=\fImapscale\fR 18
Scale of the output map,  e.g. 1:25000
.br
Default:  1panel

This parameter is provided as a convenience.  It is identical to the 
.I scale
mapping instruction described below.

.LP
Note: the user must select an output device using
.I p.select
before running \fIp.map\fR.  Also, the
.I preview
device can be selected to view the output from
.I p.map
on the graphics monitor instead of sending it to a paper printer.

.SH "MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS"
The mapping instructions allow the user to specify various spatial data
to be plotted. These instructions are normally prepared in a regular
text file using a system editor.
Some instructions are single line instructions while
others are multiple line. Multiple line instructions consist of
the main instruction followed by a subsection of one or more additional
instructions.

.SH colormode
Selects the appropriate method to color raster map layers and images.

.TS
ll.
USAGE:	\fBcolormode\fR approx\*|best
.TE

There are two methods:
.I approximate
and
.I best.
From a user perspective,
.I approximate
can be used for raster map layers with few categories,
such as soils, and
.I best
should be used for images like LANDSAT images or NHAP photos, or maps
with many categories.
The
.I approximate
mode treats each pixel independently, giving it the printer color
that best approximates the true color.  The
.I best
mode "blends" colors from pixel to pixel using a dithering technique
to simulate more colors than the printer can actually print.
The default, if unspecified, is
.I best.

This example would select the
.I approximate
colormode.  The assumption is that the raster map layer being printed is
has few colors or that the colors would not look good dithered.

.TS
ll.
EXAMPLE:	\fBcolormode\fR approx
.TE

.SH colortable
Includes the color table for the raster map layer in the legend
below the map

.TS
ll.
USAGE:	\fBcolortable\fR [y\*|n]
.TE

The color table will display the colors for each raster map layer
category value and the category label.
To get a color table, you must have previously requested a raster
map layer.
Omitting the \fBcolortable\fR instruction would result in
no color table.  \fBNote\fR:  Be careful about asking for color tables for
raster map layers which have many categories, such as elevation.
This could result in the printing of an extremely long color table!!!!!

This example would print a color table as part of the legend to the map.
.TS
ll.
EXAMPLE:	\fBcolortable\fR y
.TE


.SH comments
Prints comments beneath the map .
You may submit comment text line by line during \fIp.map\fR execution
or a via a prepared comments file.

.TS
ll.
USAGE:	\fBcomments\fR [commentfile]
	comments
	\fBend\fR
.TE

This example prints the comment "This is a comment" in the
legend below the map.
.TS
ll.
EXAMPLE:	\fBcomments\fR
	\ \ This is a comment.
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

This example prints whatever is in the file \fIveg.comments\fR in the
legend below the map.
.TS
ll.
EXAMPLE:	\fBraster\fR vegetation
	\fBcomments\fR veg.comments
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

Presumably, the file
.I veg.comments
contain comments
pertaining to the raster map layer \fIvegetation\fR,
such as "This map was created by classifying a LANDSAT TM image".


.SH defpat
Defines area fill patterns to be used in the
.I setpat
instruction.

.TS
ll.
USAGE:	\fBdefpat\fR name
	 pattern
	\fBcolor\fR # color
	\fBend\fR
.TE


The pattern is given a name on the \fIdefpat\fR
instruction line.  The pattern which follows
is composed of a sequence of numbers 0-9 (and blanks, which are equivalent to 0).
The blanks or zeros indicate holes in the pattern where the normal
category color would show thru. The other number 1-9 indicate pattern
pixels and can be assigned any color.
The default color for all the digits will be black unless specified
with the
.I color
instruction.  The color option will begin by entering the word 
.I color
followed by one of the digits (1-9) in the pattern, followed by one of
the NAMED COLORS.  This should be repeated for each of the digits specified to
avoid using black.  The instruction
.I end
terminates the pattern definition.
Of course, the user can define more patterns by entering more
.I defpat
instructions.

.B NOTE:
Do NOT indent the pattern.  Leading blank spaces will be 
interpreted as 0's.

This example creates a black horizontal line pattern.

.SH endpanel
Specifies which panel number to end printing.  The default is 0,
and will print all panels from the startpanel to the last panel.

.TS
ll.
EXAMPLE:	\fBendpanel\fR 4
.TE

This example would end output at panel 4.

.SH grid
Overlays a coordinate grid onto the output map.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBgrid\fR spacing
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR color
	\ \ \fBnumbers\fR # [color]
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

The \fBspacing\fR of the grid is given (in the geographic coordinate
system units) on the main instruction line.  The subsection instructions
allow the user to specify
the \fBcolor\fR of the grid lines,
whether coordinate \fBnumbers\fR should appear
on the grid lines, and
if they
should appear every grid line (1), every other grid line 
(2), etc., and what color the numbers should be.  The defaults are
black grid lines, unnumbered.

This example would overlay a green grid with a spacing of 10000 meters
(for a metered database, like UTM) onto the output map.  Alternate grid
lines would be numbered with red numbers.
.TS
l l.

EXAMPLE:	\fBgrid\fR 10000

.SH labels
Selects a labels file for output (see manual entry for
.I p.labels).

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBlabels\fR  labelfile\*|\fIlist\fR
.TE

This example would paint labels from the labels file called
\fItown.names\fR.  Presumably, these labels would indicate the names of
towns on the map.

.TS
ll.
EXAMPLE:	\fBlabels\fR town.names
.TE

.SH line
Draws lines on the output map.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBline\fR east north east north
	\fBline\fR x% y% x% y%
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR color
	\ \ \fBwidth\fR #
	\ \ \fBmasked\fR [y\*|n]
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

The beginning and ending points of the line are entered on the main
instruction.  These points can be defined either by map coordinates or
by using percentages of the geographic region.
The user may also specify line
.B color,
.B width
in pixels,
and if the line is to be
.B masked
by the current mask. (See manual entry for \fIr.mask\fR for more
information on the mask.)
.LP

This example would draw a yellow line from the point x\*=10% y\*=80%
to the point x\*=30% y\*=70%. This line
would be 2 pixels wide and would appear even if there is a mask.

.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBline\fR 10% 80% 30% 70%
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR yellow
	\ \ \fBwidth\fR 2
	\ \ \fBmasked\fR n
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

Of course, multiple lines may be drawn with multiple
.I line
instructions.

.SH outline
Outlines the areas of a raster map layer with a specified color.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBoutline\fR
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR  color
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

.LP
Distinct areas of the raster map will be separated from each other visually
by drawing a border (or outline) in the specified
.B color
(default: black).
Note: it is
important the user enter the instruction \fBend\fR even if a color is not
chosen.
(It is hoped that in the future the outline of a different raster map
layer other than the one currently being painted may be placed on the map.)

This example would outline the category areas of the
.I soils
raster map layer
in grey.
.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBraster\fR soils
	\fBoutline\fR   
	\fBcolor\fR grey

.SH point
Places additional points or icons on the output map.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBpoint\fR east north
	\fBpoint\fR x% y%
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR color
	\ \ \fBicon\fR iconfile\*|\fIlist\fR
	\ \ \fBsize\fR #
	\ \ \fBmasked\fR [y\*|n]
	\ \ \fBend\fR	
.TE

The point location is entered in the main instruction line by giving either the map 
coordinates or by using percentages of the geographic region.
The user may also specify the point
.B color,
the \fBicon\fR file to be used to represent the point location
(see the the manual entry for
.I p.icons),
the \fBsize\fR of the icon in integer multiples of the pattern in the icon file,
and whether the point is to be \fBmasked\fR
by the current mask. (See manual entry for \fIr.mask\fR for more
information on the mask.)

This example would place a purple diamond (from icon file
\fIdiamond\fR) at the point (E456000 N7890000).  This diamond would be the same
size it is in the diamond icon file and would not be masked by the current
mask.

.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBpoint\fR 456000 7890000
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR purple     
	\ \ \fBicon\fR diamond

	\ \ \fBmasked\fR n
	\ \ \fBend\fR	
.TE


Of course, multiple points may be drawn with multiple
.I point
instructions.

.SH raster
Selects a raster map layer for output.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBraster\fR mapname\*|\fIlist\fR
.TE

For each 
.I p.map
run, only one raster map layer can be requested.  If no raster map layer
is requested, a completely white map will be produced.
It can be useful to select no raster map layer in order to
provide a white background for vector images.

This example would paint a map of the raster map layer \fIsoils\fR.
.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBraster\fR soils
.TE


.SH read 
Provides \fIp.map\fR with a previously prepared input stream.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBread\fR previously prepared UNIX file
.TE

Mapping instructions can be placed into a file and read into
.I p.map.

.B Note:
.I p.map
will not search for this file.  The user must be in the
correct directory or specify the full path on the \fBread\fR instruction.
(Note to /bin/csh users: ~ won't work with this instruction).

This example reads the UNIX file \fIpmap.roads\fR into \fIp.map\fR.
This file may contain all the \fIp.map\fR instructions for placing
the vector map layer \fIroads\fR onto the output map.

.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE: \fBread\fR pmap.roads
.TE

The user may have created this file because this vector map layer
is particularly useful for many \fIp.map\fR
outputs.  By using the \fBread\fR option, the user need not enter all the input
for the \fBvector\fR instruction, but simply \fBread\fR the previously prepared
file with the correct instructions.

.SH region
Places the outline of a smaller geographic region
on the output.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBregion\fR regionfile\*|\fIlist\fR
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR color
	\ \ \fBwidth\fR #
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

Geographic region settings are created and saved using \fIg.region\fR.
The \fIp.map\fR \fIregion\fR option can be used to show an outline of
a smaller region which was printed on a separate run of \fIp.map\fR
on other user-created maps.

The user can specify the \fBcolor\fR
and the \fBwidth\fR (in pixel units) of the outline.
The default is a black border of one pixel width.
.LP


This example would place a white outline, 2 pixels wide, of the
geographic region
called \fIfire.zones\fR onto the output map.  This geographic region
would have been created and saved using \fIg.region\fR.

.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBregion\fR fire.zones

.SH scale
Selects a scale for the output map.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBscale\fR \fIscale\fR
.TE

The scale can be selected either as:
.IP
a relative ratio, e.g. 1:25000;
.IP
an absolute width of the printed map, e.g. 10 inches;
.IP
the number of printed paper panels, e.g. 3 panels;
.IP
the number of miles per inch, e.g. 1 inch equals 4 miles.
.LP

This example would set the scale of the map to 1 unit \*= 25000
units.
.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBscale\fR 1:25000
.TE

.SH setcolor    
Overrides the color assigned to one or more categories
of the raster map layer.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBsetcolor\fR cat(s) color
.TE


This example would set the color for categories 2,5 and 8 of the raster
map layer \fIwatersheds\fR to white and category 10 to green.
(\fBNOTE\fR: no spaces are inserted between the category values.)

.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBraster\fR watersheds
	\fBsetcolor\fR 2,5,8 white
	\fBsetcolor\fR 10 green
.TE

Of course,
.I setcolor 
can be requested more than once to override the default color for additional
categories.  More than one category can be changed for each request by listing
all the category values separated by commas (but with no spaces).

.SH setpat   
Assigns a (previously defined) pattern on a raster map layer category.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBsetpat\fR cat name
  or	\fBsetpat\fR \fIbuiltin\fP
  or	\fBsetpat\fR \fIall\fP
.TE

The user can choose to use:
the name of a specific pattern created using \fBdefpat\fR (see above);
the patterns built into \fIp.map\fR;
or all the patterns the user may have created.

This example assigns the vertical pattern created using
\fBdefpat\fR (see example in \fBdefpat\fR above) to category 3 of the raster
map layer \fIvegetation\fR and the
tree pattern (see example in \fBdefpat\fR above) to category 10. 
.TS

This example reads a previously prepared UNIX file
.I horiz.pat
with the correct 
\fBdefpat\fR instructions for creating a black horizontal pattern (see example in
\fBdefpat\fR above) and assigns that pattern to category 5 of the raster
map layer \fIsoils\fR via the \fBsetpat\fR instruction.

This example would begin printing at panel 2.

.SH sites
Selects sites data to be placed on the output map
(see manual entry for \fIs.menu\fR).

The user may specify the
the \fBcolor\fR of the sites (see section on NAMED COLORS below);
the \fBicon\fR to be used to represent the presence of a site
(see the manual entry for \fIp.icons\fR);
the \fBsize\fR of the icon (number of times larger than the size it is in
the icon file);
and
whether or not the \fBdesc\fRription associated with each site is also to be
printed.

This example would paint a sites map with blue windmills (from an icon file created
by the user using the
.I p.icons
GRASS command) placed at all windmill locations (from a sites list).  These
windmills would be two times larger than the size of the icon in the
icon file and have descriptions from the sites list file printed beside them.

The user specifies where the text will be placed by
providing map coordinates or percentages of the geographic region map.
The text follows these coordinates
on the same instruction line.
More than one line of text can be
specified by notating the end of a line with
.B \en
(e.g. USA\|\enCERL).


The user can then specify various text features:

.B font:
cyrilc gothgbt gothgrt gothitt greekc greekcs greekp greeks italicc
italiccs italict romanc romancs romand romans romant scriptc scripts
(The default font is romans);

.B color
(see NAMED COLORS);

.B width
of the lines used to draw the text (to make thicker letters);

.B size
as the vertical height of the letters in meters on the
ground (text size will grow or shrink depending on the scale at which
the map is painted);

the highlight color (\fBhcolor\fR) and
the width of the highlight color (\fBhwidth\fR);

the text-enclosing-box \fBbackground\fR color;
the text box \fBborder\fR color;

.B ref.
This reference point specifies the text handle - what
part of the text should be placed on the location specified by the map
coordinates.  Reference points can refer to:
[lower\*|upper\*|center]\ [left\*|right\*|center] of the text to be printed;

.B yoffset,
which provides finer placement of text by shifting the
text a vertical distance in pixels from the specified north.  The vertical 
offset will shift the location to the south if positive, north if negative;

.B xoffset,
which shifts the text a horizontal distance in pixels from
the specified east The horizontal offset will shift the location east if 
positive, west if negative;

whether or not the text should be \fBopaque\fR to vectors.  Entering \fBno\fR
to the opaque option will allow the user to see any vectors which go
through the text's background box.  Otherwise, they will end at the box's edge.
.LP

This example would place the text
\fISPEARFISH LAND COVER\fR
at the coordinates E650000 N7365000. The text would be a total of
3 pixels wide (2 pixels of red text and 1 pixel black highlight), have a white

the \fBwidth\fR of the vectors lines in pixels;
the highlight color (\fBhcolor\fR) for the vector lines;
the width of the highlight color (\fBhwidth\fR) in pixels;
whether or not the raster map layer is to be \fBmasked\fR
by the current mask
(see manual entry \fIr.mask\fR for more information on the mask);
and the line \fBstyle\fR.
The line style allows the vectors
to be dashed in different patterns and colors.  This is done by typing a
series of numbers (0-9) in a desired sequence or pattern.  Colors for the
numbers (1-9) can be assigned using the \fBcolor\fR instruction.  Blanks and
non-digit characters are recognized as 0's. Using 0 would allow the
colors of the raster map layer (or the background color
if no raster map layer was selected) to show through.
.LP

This example would paint a map of the vector map layer
named \fIstreams\fR.
These streams would be a total of 3 pixels wide (the inner two pixels blue and

.SH ICONS VS. PATTERNS
Icons and patterns as used in \fIp.map\fR are not the same thing.
Patterns are defined and are normally used to cover those extended areas
covered by a raster map layer category.  A pattern will repeat
above, below and adjacent to itself.
Icons are used to represent a single point.

Patterns are supported directly within
.I p.map
using the
.I defpat
instruction, while icons must be created
using the
