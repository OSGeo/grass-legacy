NAME
     r.in.poly - Create	raster maps from ascii polygon/line data
     files in the current directory.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.poly
     r.in.poly help
     r.in.poly input=name output=name [title="phrase"]
     [rows=value]

DESCRIPTION
     r.in.poly allows the creation of GRASS ASCII files	in the
     current directory containing polygon and linear features.

COMMAND	LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters

     input=name		 Unix input file, in ascii format,
			 containing the	polygon	and linear
			 features.  The	format of this file is
			 described in the section INPUT	FORMAT
			 below.

     output=name	 Raster	output file

     title="phrase"	 Title for resultant raster map
			 (optional)

     rows		 Number	of rows	to hold	in memory
			 (default: 512).  This parameter allows
			 users with less memory	(or more) on
			 their system to control how much memory
			 r.in.poly uses.

INPUT FORMAT
     The input format for the input file consists of sections
     describing	either polygonal areas or linear features.  The
     basic format is:
     A			    <for polygonal areas>
	 easting northing
	 .
	 .
	 .
     =	 cat# label
     L			    <for linear	features>
	 easting northing
	 .
	 .
	 .
     =	 cat# label
     The A signals the beginning of a polygon. It must appear in

     the first column. The L signal the	beginning of a linear
     feature. It also must appear in the first column. The
     coordinates of the	vertices of the	polygon, or the
     coordinates defining the linear feature follow and	must have
     a space in	the first column and at	least one space	between
     the easting and the northing. To give meaning to the
     features, the = indicates that the	feature	currently being
     processed has category value cat# (which must be an integer)
     and a label (which	may be more than one word, or which may
     be	omitted).
