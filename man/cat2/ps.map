NAME
     ps.map - Hardcopy PostScript map output utility.
     (GRASS Hardcopy PostScript	Output Program)

SYNOPSIS
     ps.map
     ps.map help
     ps.map [r]	[input=name] [scale=mapscale] [copies=n]
     output=name

DESCRIPTION
     ps.map produces an	output file containing a PostScript
     program to	produce	hardcopy map products on your system's
     PostScript	output device.	Output can include a raster map,
     any number	of vector overlays, site data, text labels, and
     other spatial data.

     This program has 2	distincts modes	of operation.  The
     command-line mode requires	the user to prepare a file of
     mapping instructions describing the various spatial and
     textual information to be printed prior to	running	ps.map.
     The interactive mode (i.e., no command-line arguments) will
     prompt the	user for items to be mapped and	does not require
     the user to prepare a file	of instructions.

     The command line flag is:

     r		       Rotate plot 90 degrees.


     The command-line parameters are:

     input=name	       File containing mapping instructions.  (or
		       enter input=- to	enter from keyboard).
		       These instructions are described	in detail
		       below.

     scale=mapscale    Scale of	the output map,	 e.g. 1:25000
		       Default:	 1 panel

		       This parameter is provided as a
		       convenience.  It	is identical to	the scale
		       mapping instruction described below.

     output=name       Name of output the file to contain the
		       PostScript program.


     Note: the user must select	a PostScript output device using
     ps.select before running ps.map.

MAPPING	INSTRUCTIONS
     The mapping instructions allow the	user to	specify	various
     spatial data to be	plotted. These instructions are	normally
     prepared in a regular text	file using a system editor.  Some
     instructions are single line instructions while others are
     multiple line. Multiple line instructions consist of the
     main instruction followed by a subsection of one or more
     additional	instructions.

     Instructions that may be included in the subsection under
     several different main instructions are:

     where x y	       The top left corner of the bounding box of
		       the item	to be plotted is located x inches
		       from the	left edge of the paper and y
		       inches from the top edge	of the paper. If
		       x is less than or equal to zero,	the
		       default horizontal location is used.  If	y
		       is less than or equal to	zero, the default
		       vertical	location is used.

     font font name    The name	of the PostScript font.	 The
		       default is Helvetica.

     fontsize font size
		       The size	of the PostScript font in 1/72
		       inch.  The default is 10.


colortable
     Prints the	color table for	the raster map layer anywhere on
     the page.

     USAGE:   colortable [y|n]
		where x	y
		width table width
		cols table columns
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		color text color
		end

     The color table will display the colors for each raster map
     layer category value and the category label.  To get a color
     table, you	must have previously requested a raster	map
     layer.  The default location for the colortable is
     immediately below any other map legend information, starting
     at	the left margin.  The default text color is black.
     Omitting the colortable instruction would result in no color
     table.  Note:  Be careful about asking for	color tables for
     raster map	layers which have many categories, such	as
     elevation.	 This could result in the printing of an



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			2






ps.map <alpha>	     GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     extremely long color table!!!!!

     This example would	print a	color table immediately	below any
     other map legend information, starting at the left	margin.
     EXAMPLE:	colortable y



comments
     Prints comments anywhere on the page.

     USAGE:   comments commentfile
		where x	y
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		color text color
		end

     The default location is immediately below the last	item item
     printed, starting at the left margin.  The	default	text
     color is black.

     This example prints in blue whatever is in	the file
     veg.comments starting at 1.5 inches from the left edge of
     the page and 7.25 inches from the top of the page,	using a
     15/72 inch	Helvetica Bold font.
     EXAMPLE:	raster vegetation
		comments veg.comments
		  where	1.5 7.25
		  font Helvetica Bold
		  fontsize 15
		  color	blue
		  end

     Presumably, the file veg.comments contain comments
     pertaining	to the raster map layer	vegetation, such as "This
     map was created by	classifying a LANDSAT TM image".



copies
     Specifies the number of copies to be printed.

     USAGE:   copies n

     Each page will be printed n times.



greyrast
     Selects a raster map layer	for output in shades of	grey.




GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			3






ps.map <alpha>	     GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     USAGE:   greyrast mapname|list

     For each ps.map run, only one raster map layer can	be
     requested (using either the greyrast or the raster
     instruction).



grid
     Overlays a	coordinate grid	onto the output	map.

     USAGE:   grid spacing
		color color
		numbers	# [color]
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		end

     The spacing of the	grid is	given (in the geographic
     coordinate	system units) on the main instruction line.  The
     subsection	instructions allow the user to specify the color
     of	the grid lines,	whether	coordinate numbers should appear
     on	the grid lines,	and if they should appear every	grid line
     (1), every	other grid line	(2), etc., and what color the
     numbers should be.	 The defaults are black	grid lines,
     unnumbered.

     This example would	overlay	a green	grid with a spacing of
     10000 meters (for a metered database, like	UTM) onto the
     output map.  Alternate grid lines would be	numbered with red
     numbers.

     EXAMPLE:	grid 10000
		  color	green
		  numbers 2 red
		  end



header
     Prints the	map header above the map.

     USAGE:   header
		file header file
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		color text color
		end

     If	the header instruction or the file sub-instruction is
     absent, the header	will consist of	the map	title and
     location, each centered on	the page above the map.	 The



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			4






ps.map <alpha>	     GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     default text color	is black.

     This example prints (in red) whatever is in the file
     soils.hdr above the map, using a 20/72 inch Courier font.
     EXAMPLE:	header
		  file soils.hdr
		  font Courier
		  fontsize 20
		  color	red
		  end




labels
     Selects a labels file for output (see manual entry	for
     p.labels).

     USAGE:   labels  labelfile|list
		font font name
		end

     This example would	paint labels from the labels file called
     town.names.  Presumably, these labels would indicate the
     names of towns on the map.

     EXAMPLE:	labels town.names



line
     Draws lines on the	output map.

     USAGE:   line east	north east north
	      line x% y% x% y%
		color color
		width #
		masked [y|n]
		end

     The beginning and ending points of	the line are entered on
     the main instruction.  These points can be	defined	either by
     map coordinates or	by using percentages of	the geographic
     region.  The user may also	specify	line color, width in
     pixels (accepts decimal points [floating points] as well as
     integers),	and if the line	is to be masked	by the current
     mask. (See	manual entry for r.mask	for more information on
     the mask.)

     This example would	draw a yellow line from	the point x=10%
     y=80% to the point	x=30% y=70%. This line would be	2 pixels
     wide and would appear even	if there is a mask.



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			5






ps.map <alpha>	     GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     EXAMPLE:	line 10% 80% 30% 70%
		  color	yellow
		  width	2
		  masked n
		  end

     Of	course,	multiple lines may be drawn with multiple line
     instructions.



mapinfo
     Prints the	portion	of the map legend containing the scale,
     grid and region information, on or	below the map.

     USAGE:   mapinfo
		where x	y
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		color text color
		end

     The default location is immediately below the map,	starting
     at	the left edge of the map.  The default text color is
     black.

     This example prints (in brown) the	scale, grid and	region
     information immediately below the map and starting	1.5
     inches from the left edge of the page, using a 12/72 inch
     Courier font.
     EXAMPLE:	mapinfo
		  where	1.5 0
		  font Courier
		  fontsize 12
		  color	brown
		  end



maploc
     Positions the map on the page.

     USAGE:   maploc  x	y [width height]

     The upper left corner of the map will be positioned x inches
     from the left edge	of the page and	y inches from the top of
     the page.	If width and height (in	inches)	are present, the
     map will be rescaled, if necessary, to fit.

     This example positions the	upper left corner of the map 2.0
     inches from the left edge and 3.5 inches from the top edge
     of	the map.

     EXAMPLE:	maploc 2.0 3.5



outline
     Outlines the areas	of a raster map	layer with a specified
     color.

     USAGE:   outline
		color  color
		width  width of	line in	pixels
		end


     Distinct areas of the raster map will be separated	from each
     other visually by drawing a border	(or outline) in	the
     specified color (default: black). For width the program
     accepts decimal points [floating points] as well as
     integers.	Note: it is important the user enter the
     instruction end even if a color is	not chosen.  (It is hoped
     that in the future	the outline of a different raster map
     layer other than the one currently	being painted may be
     placed on the map.)

     This example would	outline	the category areas of the soils
     raster map	layer in grey.
     EXAMPLE:	raster soils
		outline
		color grey
		width 2
		end


point
     Places additional points or icons on the output map.

     USAGE:   point east north
	      point x% y%
		color color
		icon iconfile|list
		size #
		masked [y|n]
		end

     The point location	is entered in the main instruction line
     by	giving either the map coordinates or by	using percentages
     of	the geographic region.	The user may also specify the
     point color, the icon file	to be used to represent	the point
     location (see the the manual entry	for ps.icons), the size
     of	the icon as a multiple of the size of the pattern in the
     icon file (default	is 1.0,	aprroximately equivalent to a 10
     point character), and whether the point is	to be masked by



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			7






ps.map <alpha>	     GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     the current mask. (See manual entry for r.mask for	more
     information on the	mask.)

     This example would	place a	purple diamond (from icon file
     diamond) at the point (E456000 N7890000).	This diamond
     would be the approximately	the size of a 15 point character
     and would not be masked by	the current mask.

     EXAMPLE:	point 456000 7890000
		  color	purple
		  icon diamond
		  size 1.5
		  masked n
		  end


     Of	course,	multiple points	may be drawn with multiple point
     instructions.


psfile
     Copies a file containing PostScript commands into the output
     file.

     Note: ps.map will not search for this file.  The user must
     be	in the correct directory or specify the	full path on the
     psfile instruction.  (Note	to /bin/csh users: ~ won't work
     with this instruction).

     USAGE:   psfile filename

     This example copies the file "logo.ps" into the output file.

     EXAMPLE:	psfile logo.ps


raster
     Selects a raster map layer	for output.

     USAGE:   raster mapname|list

     For each ps.map run, only one raster map layer can	be
     requested.	 If no raster map layer	is requested, a
     completely	white map will be produced.  It	can be useful to
     select no raster map layer	in order to provide a white
     background	for vector images.

     This example would	paint a	map of the raster map layer
     soils.
     EXAMPLE:	raster soils





GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			8






ps.map <alpha>	     GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



read
     Provides ps.map with a previously prepared	input stream.

     USAGE:   read previously prepared UNIX file

     Mapping instructions can be placed	into a file and	read into
     ps.map.

     Note: ps.map will not search for this file.  The user must
     be	in the correct directory or specify the	full path on the
     read instruction.	(Note to /bin/csh users: ~ won't work
     with this instruction).

     This example reads	the UNIX file pmap.roads into ps.map.
     This file may contain all the ps.map instructions for
     placing the vector	map layer roads	onto the output	map.

     EXAMPLE: read pmap.roads

     The user may have created this file because this vector map
     layer is particularly useful for many ps.map outputs.  By
     using the read option, the	user need not enter all	the input
     for the vector instruction, but simply read the previously
     prepared file with	the correct instructions.


region
     Places the	outline	of a smaller geographic	region on the
     output.

     USAGE:   region regionfile|list
		color color
		width #
		end

     Geographic	region settings	are created and	saved using
     g.region.	The ps.map region option can be	used to	show an
     outline of	a smaller region which was printed on a	separate
     run of ps.map on other user-created maps.

     The user can specify the color and	the width in pixel units
     (accepts decimal points [floating points] as well as
     integers) of the outline.	The default is a black border of
     one pixel width.

     This example would	place a	white outline, 2 pixels	wide, of
     the geographic region called fire.zones onto the output map.
     This geographic region would have been created and	saved
     using g.region.

     EXAMPLE:	region fire.zones
		  color	white

ps.map <alpha>	     GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



		  width	2
		  end


scale
     Selects a scale for the output map.

     USAGE:   scale scale

     The scale can be selected either as:

	  a relative ratio, e.g. 1:25000;

	  an absolute width of the printed map,	e.g. 10	inches;

	  the number of	printed	paper panels, e.g. 3 panels (at
	  the present time, only 1 panel is supported);

	  the number of	miles per inch,	e.g. 1 inch equals 4
	  miles.

     This example would	set the	scale of the map to 1 unit =
     25000 units.
     EXAMPLE:	scale 1:25000


setcolor
     Overrides the color assigned to one or more categories of
     the raster	map layer.

     USAGE:   setcolor cat(s) color


     This example would	set the	color for categories 2,5 and 8 of
     the raster	map layer watersheds to	white and category 10 to
     green.  (NOTE: no spaces are inserted between the category
     values.)

     EXAMPLE:	raster watersheds
		setcolor 2,5,8 white
		setcolor 10 green

     Of	course,	setcolor can be	requested more than once to
     override the default color	for additional categories.  More
     than one category can be changed for each request by listing
     all the category values separated by commas (but with no
     spaces).



sites
     Selects sites data	to be placed on	the output map (see



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University		       10






ps.map <alpha>	     GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     manual entry for s.menu).

     USAGE:   sites sitemap|list
		color color
		icon iconfile|list
		size #
		desc [y|n]
		font font name
		end

     The user may specify the the color	of the sites (see section
     on	NAMED COLORS below); the icon to be used to represent the
     presence of a site	(see the manual	entry for p.icons); the
     size of the icon (number of times larger than the size it is
     in	the icon file);	and whether or not the description
     associated	with each site is also to be printed.  If the
     description is to be printed, the font name may be
     specified.	 The size of the font is proportional to the icon
     size.  This example would paint a sites map with blue
     windmills (from an	icon file created by the user using the
     p.icons GRASS command) placed at all windmill locations
     (from a sites list).  These windmills would be two	times
     larger than the size of the icon in the icon file and have
     descriptions from the sites list file printed beside them.
     EXAMPLE:	sites windmills
		  color	blue
		  icon windmill
		  size 2
		  desc y
		  end


text
     Places text on the	map.

     USAGE:   text  east north text
	      text  x% y% text
		font fontname
		color color|none
		width #
		hcolor color|none
		hwidth #
		background color|none
		border color|none
		size #
		ref reference point
		xoffset	#
		yoffset	#
		opaque [y|n]
		end





GRASS 4.2		Baylor University		       11






ps.map <alpha>	     GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     The user specifies	where the text will be placed by
     providing map coordinates or percentages of the geographic
     region map.  The text follows these coordinates on	the same
     instruction line.	More than one line of text can be
     specified by notating the end of a	line with \n (e.g.
     USA\nCERL).


     The user can then specify various text features:

     font: cyrilc gothgbt gothgrt gothitt greekc greekcs greekp
     greeks italicc italiccs italict romanc romancs romand romans
     romant scriptc scripts (The default font is romans);

     color (see	NAMED COLORS);

     width of the lines	used to	draw the text to make thicker
     letters (accepts decimal points [floating points] as well as
     integers);

     size as the vertical height of the	letters	in meters on the
     ground (text size will grow or shrink depending on	the scale
     at	which the map is painted);

     the highlight color (hcolor) and the width	of the highlight
     color (hwidth);

     the text-enclosing-box background color; the text box border
     color;

     ref. This reference point specifies the text handle - what
     part of the text should be	placed on the location specified
     by	the map	coordinates.  Reference	points can refer to:
     [lower|upper|center] [left|right|center] of the text to be
     printed;

     yoffset, which provides finer placement of	text by	shifting
     the text a	vertical distance in pixels from the specified
     north.  The vertical offset will shift the	location to the
     south if positive,	north if negative;

     xoffset, which shifts the text a horizontal distance in
     pixels from the specified east The	horizontal offset will
     shift the location	east if	positive, west if negative;

     whether or	not the	text should be opaque to vectors.
     Entering no to the	opaque option will allow the user to see
     any vectors which go through the text's background	box.
     Otherwise,	they will end at the box's edge.

     This example would	place the text SPEARFISH LAND COVER at
     the coordinates E650000 N7365000. The text	would be a total



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University		       12






ps.map <alpha>	     GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     of	3 pixels wide (2 pixels	of red text and	1 pixel	black
     highlight), have a	white background enclosed in a red box,
     and be 500	meters in size.	 The lower right corner	of the
     text would	be centered over the coordinates provided.  All
     vectors on	the map	would stop at the border of this text.
     EXAMPLE:	text 650000 7365000 SPEARFISH LAND COVER
		  font romand
		  color	red
		  width	2
		  hcolor black
		  hwidth 1
		  background white
		  border red
		  size 500
		  ref lower left
		  opaque y
		  end



vector
     Selects a vector map layer	for output.

     USAGE:   vector vectormap|list
		color color
		width #
		hcolor color
		hwidth #
		masked [y|n]
		style  0-9
		end

     The user can specify the color of the vectors; the	width of
     the vectors lines in pixels (accepts decimal points
     [floating points] as well as integers); the highlight color
     (hcolor) for the vector lines; the	width of the highlight
     color (hwidth) in pixels; whether or not the raster map
     layer is to be masked by the current mask (see manual entry
     r.mask for	more information on the	mask); and the line
     style.  The line style allows the vectors to be dashed in
     different patterns.  This is done by typing a series of
     numbers (0's and 1's) in a	desired	sequence or pattern.
     Blanks and	non-digit characters are recognized as 0's. Using
     0 would allow the colors of the raster map	layer (or the
     background	color if no raster map layer was selected) to
     show through.

     This example would	paint a	map of the vector map layer named
     streams.  These streams would be a	total of 3 pixels wide
     (the inner	two pixels blue	and the	outer highlight	pixel
     white).  The map would not	show streams outside of	the
     current mask.

     EXAMPLE:	vector streams
		  color	blue
		  width	2
		  hcolor white
		  hwidth 1
		  masked y
		  end




verbose
     Changes the amount	of talking ps.map will do.

     USAGE: verbose [0|1|2]

     A higher value implies more chatter.  The default is 2.
     This example sets the amount of chatter to	a minimum.

     EXAMPLE:	verbose	0



vlegend
     Prints the	portion	of the map legend containing the vector
     information, on or	below the map.

     USAGE:   vlegend
		where x	y
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		end

     The default location is immediately below the legend
     containing	the scale, grid	and region information,	starting
     at	the left edge of the map.  If the where	instruction is
     present and y is less than	or equal to zero, the vector
     legend will be positioned immediately below the map,
     starting x	inches from the	left edge of the page.

     This example prints the vector legend immediately below the
     map and starting 4.5 inches from the left edge of the page,
     using a 12/72 inch	Helvetica font.
     EXAMPLE:	vlegend
		  where	4.5 0
		  font Courier
		  fontsize 12
		  end


end
