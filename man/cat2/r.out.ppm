r.out.ppm <alpha>    GRASS Reference Manual	<alpha>	r.out.ppm



NAME
     r.out.ppm - Converts a GRASS raster file to a PPM image file
     at	the pixel resolution of	the CURRENTLY DEFINED REGION.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.out.ppm
     r.out.ppm help
     r.out.ppm -qG ] [ input=name ] [ output=name ]


DESCRIPTION
     r.flow The	PPM file created is 24bit color, rawbits storage
     by	default.  Using	-G, you	may force r.out.ppm to use 8bit
     greyscale instead.	 The greyscale conversion uses the NTSC
     conversion:  Y = .30*Red +	.59*Green + .11*Blue.  One pixel
     is	written	for each cell value, so	if ew_res and ns_res
     differ, the aspect	ratio of the resulting image will be off.

     Parameters:


     input=name	       Raster file to be converted.


     output=name       Name for	new PPM	file. (use out=- for
		       stdout) default:	<rasterfilename>.ppm


NOTES
     A few ppm file comments are written - the name of the GRASS
     raster file, resolution, etc.  Although these are perfectly
     legal, I've found one PD image utility that chokes	on them,
     so	if you need a commentless ppm file, use	out=- >
     outfile.ppm. (When	sending	output to stdout, no comments are
     written.)

NOTICE
     This program is part of the alpha section of the GRASS
     distribution.  Unlike the code in the main	section	of GRASS,
     the alpha code has	not yet	been fully tested for one release
     cycle.
