# CONFIGURE: define which of the four sub-packages you want to make.  PBM
# is required; PNM is recommended; and if you want PPM you must have PGM
# too.  This means there are only six possibilities:
SUBDIRS =	pbm pgm ppm pnm
# SUBDIRS =	pbm pgm ppm
# SUBDIRS =	pbm pgm pnm
# SUBDIRS =	pbm pgm
# SUBDIRS =	pbm pnm
# SUBDIRS =	pbm
