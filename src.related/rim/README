First run either SETUP-BSD or SETUP-AIX.
You have to tell SETUP-BSD whether your fortran wants
OPEN's RECL parameter in bytes or words.

The 'things' to make are:

   rim       - the main program
   librim.a  - the program interface library
   rime      - an editor for the database
   help      - builds the help database (may require librim.a to be installed)
   install   - moves everything to installed positions
   lxtest    - a test program for the text i/o routines
   clean     - removes 'rimh' and the objects from 'src'

What's it good for?

Experience has convinced me that Rim is best for databases
that will be updated by programs.  It provides a convenient
program interface and much support for loading and unloading
and maintaining databases.  It does not, however, present
a very convenient user interface for adding or changing data.
It has no screens.  It does allow applications to be very 
portable---as long as you keep them clean of system dependencies.
