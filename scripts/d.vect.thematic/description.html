<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<p><EM><b>d.vect.thematic</b></EM>  - Creates thematic  maps from vectors of
  all types and numeric attributes (stored in the data table connected to a vector
  map). Thematic maps can be displayed by either a graduated color scheme (for
  all vector types), or as graduated icon sizes (for point and centroid types).
  The user selects the vector file to be mapped and attribute column from which
  to derive mapping intervals, and (optionally) the layer for attribute data. </p>
<p>In thematic maps, the color or point size changes for each range of attribute
  values. Value ranges for thematic mapping can be
  set at regular intervals, standard deviation units on either
  side of the mean, quartiles, or delimited by user-defined breakpoints. User-defined
  breakpoints also can  be piped into d.vect.thematic from standard input or
  other external source. </p>
<p>There are options to define the color scheme (graduated
    colors) and range of point sizes (graduated points) for thematic maps. A
  simple text legend is printed. Optionally, a graphic legend can be drawn in
  the selected display monitor. Thematic colors can be uploaded to a GRASSRGB
  column for later display,  and thematic map display commands can
  be saved to a group file (*.dm) that can be opened, edited, and displayed in
the GIS Manager.</p>

<H2>ATTENTION</H2>

The algorithm currently uses the script <EM><A HREF="v.univar.sh.html">v.univar.sh</A></EM>
to calculate basic descriptive statistics needed for thematic mapping (minimum,
maximum, mean, standard deviation, and quartiles).
