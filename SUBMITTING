Dear (new) GRASS Developer,

When submitting C code to GRASS CVS repository, please take
care of following rules:

[ see SUBMITTING_SCRIPTS for script hints ]


1.  Get and read the GRASS 6 Programmer's Manual here:
    http://grass.itc.it/devel/index.php#prog

  or generate it from this source code (the programmer's manual
  is integrated in the source code in doxygen style):
    make htmldocs
    make pdfdocs


2.  Use the directory structure to place your module appropriately into
    the source tree
    	- libes go into lib/
    	- raster goes into raster/
    	- vector goes into vector/
    	- ...

    Consider to take a look at "GNU Coding Standards"
    http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards.html                                          

3.  Add a header section to each file you submit and make sure you include
    the copyright. The purpose section is meant to contain a general
    overview of the code in the file to assist other programmers that will
    need to make changes to your code.

    Example (ficticious header for a file called color.c) :

/*
****************************************************************************
*
* MODULE:       d.rast (or new higher level module name (eg GRASS core) 
*   	    	for 6.1)
* AUTHOR(S):    Original author unknown - probably CERL
*               John Doe - jdoe@some.where.org
* PURPOSE:      To provide storage and manipulation of colors used for 
*               rendering the raster. The colors are stored in a doubly linked
*   	    	list which must be initialized with InitColors() before it can
*   	    	be used. Note that most linked list functionality (add,
*   	    	remove, get) is supported, but their is no sorting
*   	    	functionality.
* COPYRIGHT:    (C) 2005 by the GRASS Development Team
*
*               This program is free software under the GNU General Public
*   	    	License (>=v2). Read the file COPYING that comes with GRASS
*   	    	for details.

    License (www.gnu.org).

4.  - deleted.
    We don't want the $ ID $ in source code any more as it
    causes problems for the CVS branches.

5.  To ensure that the software system continues to work, please include

	#include "config.h"

    in your files and make use of the various system dependencies
    contained therein.  As one example of this, see
    src/paint/Interface/driverlib/io.c.  Please refrain from declaring
    system functions within the software; include the proper header files
    (conditionally dependent on config.h macros if necessary) instead.

6. Order of include headers

    In general, headers should be included in the order:
 
    1. Core system headers (stdio.h, ctype.h, ...)
    2. Headers for non-core system components (X11, libraries).
    3. Headers for core systems of the package being compiled (gis.h, glocale.h ...)
    4. Headers for the specific library/program being compiled (geodesic.h, ...)
 
    Each class of header has an obligation to be compatible with those
    above it in the list, but not those below it.
    
7.  Always specify the return type for ALL functions including those that
    return type "void", and insert return statements for ALL functions.
    Also, use ANSI C prototypes to declare your functions. Examples:
    
    void G_something(void);
    int G_somethingElse(int, int);
    
    void G_something(void)
    {
    	/* Snipped out code */
	
	return;
    }
    
    int G_somethingElse(int x, int y)
    {
    	/* Snipped out code */
	
	return(0);
    }
    
8.  Use fprintf instead of printf. But:
    
    For errors and warnings please use the G_fatal_error() and
    G_warning() functions. General messages for the user should use
    G_message() while debug messages should use G_debug() whenever
    possible.

    G_message() output is not expected to be sent to pipe or file.

    For data output redirected to pipe or file, please use fprintf() and 
    specify the stdout stream as follows:

      fprintf(stdout, ...);
      fflush(stdout);

      fflush(stdout) always required when using fprintf(stdout, ...).

    i18N: Add gettext macros with _("") (see ./locale/README for details)

9.  Use the following GRASS library functions instead of the standard C
    functions. The reason for this is that the following functions ensure
    good programming practice (eg always checking if memory was allocated)
    and/or improves portability. PLEASE refer to the programmers manual
    for the proper use (eg determining if any casts are needed for arguments
    or return values) of these library functions. They may perform a task
    slightly different from their corresponding C library function, and thus,
    their use may not be the same.
    
    	G_malloc() instead of malloc()
	G_calloc() instead of calloc()
	G_realloc() instead of realloc()
	G_free() instead of free()
	G_getenv() instead of getenv()
	G_setenv() instead of setenv()
	G_unsetenv() instead of unsetenv()
	G_sleep() instead of sleep()

	Could somebody please add others (please verify that they are
	useful and safe first)

10. Use the GRASS library function G_asprintf() instead of the 
    standard C functions asprintf(), vsnprintf() and snprintf().  These 
    functions are not portable or have other issues.  Example:

    char *msg;

    G_asprintf(&msg, "%s", parameters);
    do_something_with_msg();
    G_free(msg);

    Note that you should free memory when G_asprintf() is used.

11. Don't use the C++ comment style! This confuses several compilers.
    Use instead:
       /* C-comments */

    If you want to comment code portions, use
       #ifdef notdef 
            portion_to_be_commented;
       #endif
    This is safe comparing to nested /* comments */

    Functions in the library must be documented in doxygen style to
    get them into the programmer's manual (generate with 
      make pdfdocs  or
      make htmldocs
    ). See lib/gis/*.c for examples.

12. PLEASE take the time to add comments throughout your code explaining what
    the code is doing. It will save a HUGE amount of time and frustration for
    other programmers that may have to change your code in the future.
    
13. Platform dependent code:
    Do not remove #ifdef __CYGWIN__ and/or #ifndef __CYGWIN__ lines and 
    their encapsulated lines from source code (one example was that someone
    removed drand48 definition.)

14. Exit status is defined as EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE, e.g.

    {
      ...
      if (G_parser (argc, argv))
          exit (EXIT_FAILURE);

      ...
      exit (EXIT_SUCCESS)
    }

15. Make sure a new line is at the end of each file

16. When writing Makefiles, use the current standard

    Example: see raster/r.info/Makefile or others

17. Have a look at ./INSTALL

18. Have a function included in your module which writes to the history
    file of the map (e.g. command line, parameters etc.). See eg
    raster/r.slope.aspect/main.c

    (the same applies to vector modules!)

19. Standard parser options: use G_define_standard_option() whenever possible
    to define standard module command line options. This will save you time,
    create fewer bugs, and make things easier on the translators.
    See lib/gis/parser.c for details of the function definition.

20. Place the documentation in HTML format into description.html
    The easiest way to do this is to study an existing HTML page
    (to get the page style, e.g. vector/v.to.db/description.html).
    
    The online WWW man pages will be updated every Saturday by CVS.

21. Add/update, if required the related d.m menu:
     display/d.m/menu.tcl

22. For consistency, use README rather than README.txt for any README files.

23. GRASS/Environment variables:
    If you add a new variable, please follow the naming convention.
    All variables are described in
    lib/init/variables.html

24. Be sure to develop on top of the LATEST GRASS code (which is in CVS).
    You can re-check before submission with 'cvs diff':

    Be sure to create unified ("diff -u") format. "Plain"
    diffs (the default format) are risky, because they will apply without
    warning to code which has been substantially changed; they are also
    harder to read than unified.

    Such diffs should be made from the top-level directory, e.g.
    "cvs diff -u display/d.vect/main.c"; that way, the diff will
    include the pathname rather than just "main.c".

25. Tell the other developers about the new code using the following e-mail:
    grass5@grass.itc.it
 
    To subscribe to this mailing list, see

26. In case of questions feel free to contact the developers at the above
    mailing list.
