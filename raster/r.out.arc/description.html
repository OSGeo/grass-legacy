<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM>r.out.arc</EM> converts a user-specified raster map layer
(<B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>) into an ESRI ARC-GRID ascii file
(<B>output=</B><EM>name</EM>) suitable for export to other computer systems. 
The dp=<EM>value</EM> option (where <EM>value</EM> is a number of the user's
choice) can be used to request that numbers after decimal points are
limited.  However, to use this, the user should know the maximum number of
digits that will occur in the output file.  The user can find the maximum
number of digits occurring in the output file by running <EM>r.out.arc</EM>
without the <B>dp=</B><EM>value</EM> option.


<P>

The GRASS program <EM><A HREF="r.in.arc.html">r.in.arc</A></EM> can be used
to perform the reverse function, converting an ESRI ARC-GRID ascii file in
suitable format to GRASS raster file format. The order of cell values in
file is from lower left to upper right (reverse to GRASS).

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The output from <EM>r.out.arc</EM> may also be placed into a file
by using the UNIX redirection mechanism;  e.g.:

<DL>
<DD>
<B>r.out.arc input=</B>soils <B>output=-</B> &gt; out.grd
</DL>

The output file <EM>out.grd</EM> can then be copied
onto a CDROM or floppy disk for export purposes.

<P><BR>
An Arc ASCII grid can be loaded into ArcGIS 8.3 though ArcToolbox.<BR>
Use the "Import to Raster" -> "ASCII to Grid" tool to create a binary grid 
which can be selected using ArcCatalog. The spatial analyst extension may 
need to be installed and activated within Arc.
