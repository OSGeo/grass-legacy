<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r.neighbors</EM> looks at each cell in a raster input
file, and examines the values assigned to the
cells in some user-defined "neighborhood" around it.  It
outputs a new raster map layer in which each cell is
assigned a value that is some (user-specified)
function of the values in that cell's neighborhood.  For
example, each cell in the output layer might be assigned a
value equal to the average of the values
appearing in its 3 x 3 cell "neighborhood" in the input
layer.


<P>

The program will be run non-interactively if the user
specifies program arguments (see OPTIONS) on the command
line.  Alternately, the user can simply type
<B>r.neighbors</B> on the command line, without program
arguments.  In this case, the user will be prompted for
flag settings and parameter values.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The user must specify the names of the raster map layers to
be used for <EM>input</EM> and <EM>output</EM>, the
<EM>method</EM> used to analyze neighborhood
values (i.e., the neighborhood function or operation to be
performed), and the <EM>size</EM> of the neighborhood.
Optionally, the user can also specify the <EM>TITLE</EM> to
be assigned to the raster map layer <EM>output</EM>, elect
to not align the resolution of the output with that of the
input (the <EM>-a</EM> option), run <EM>r.neighbors</EM> with
a custom matrix weights with the <EM>weight</EM> option, and
elect to run<EM>r.neighbors</EM> quietly (the <EM>-q</EM> option).
These options are described further below.


<P>

<EM>Neighborhood Operation Methods:</EM>
The <EM>neighborhood</EM> operators determine what new 
value a center cell in a neighborhood will have after examining
values inside its neighboring cells.
Each cell in a raster map layer becomes the center cell of a neighborhood 
as the neighborhood window moves from cell to cell throughout the map layer.
<EM>r.neighbors</EM>
can perform the following operations:


<P>
<DL>

<DT><B>average</B> 

<DD>The average value within the neighborhood.
In the following example, the result would be:

<BR>

(7*4 + 6 + 5 + 4*3)/9 = 5.66

<BR>

The result is rounded to the nearest integer (in this case 6).

<DT><B>median</B> 

<DD>The value found half-way through a list of the
neighborhood's values,
when these are ranged in numerical order.

<DT><B>mode</B> 

<DD>The most frequently occurring value in the neighborhood.

<DT><B>minimum</B> 

<DD>The minimum value within the neighborhood.

<DT><B>maximum</B> 

<DD>The maximum value within the neighborhood.

<DT><B>stddev</B> 

<DD>The statistical standard deviation of values
within the neighborhood (rounded to the nearest integer).

<DT><B>sum</B> 

<DD>The sum of values within the neighborhood.

<DT><B>variance</B> 

<DD>The statistical variance of values
within the neighborhood (rounded to the nearest integer).

<DT><B>diversity</B> 

<DD>The number of different values within the neighborhood.
In the above example, the diversity is 4.

<DT><B>interspersion</B> 

<DD>The percentage of cells containing values which differ from the values
assigned to the center cell in the neighborhood, plus 1.
In the above example, the interspersion is:

<BR>

5/8 * 100 + 1 = 63.5

<BR>

The result is rounded to the nearest integer (in this case 64).

<EM>Neighborhood Size:</EM>
<DD>The neighborhood <EM>size</EM> specifies which cells surrounding any given
cell fall into the neighborhood for that cell.
The size must be an odd integer.
For example,
<PRE>
                              _ _ _
                             |_|_|_| 
    3 x 3 neighborhood ---&gt;  |_|_|_|
                             |_|_|_|

</PRE>
</DD>
<P>

<EM>Matrix weights:</EM>
<DD>A custom matrix can be used if none of the neighborhood operation
methods are desirable by using the <EM>weight</EM>.  This option must
be used in conjunction with the <EM>size</EM> option to specify the
matrix size.  The weights desired are to be entered into a text file.
For example, to calculate the focal mean with a matrix <EM>size</EM> of
3,
<PRE>
r.neigbors in=input.map out=output.map size=3 weight=weights.txt
</PRE>

The contents of the weight.txt file:
<PRE>
3 3 3
1 4 8
9 5 3
</PRE>

This corresponds to the following 3x3 matrix:
<PRE>
    -------
    |3|3|3|
    -------
    |1|4|8|
    -------
    |9|5|3|
    -------
</PRE>

<P>


<DT><B>-a</B> 

<DD>If specified, <EM>r.neighbors</EM> will not align the output
raster map layer with that of the input raster map layer.
The <EM>r.neighbors</EM> program works in the current geographic region.
It is recommended, but not required, that the resolution
of the geographic region be the same as that of the raster map layer.
By default, if unspecified,
<EM>r.neighbors</EM> will align these geographic region settings.

<DT><B>-q</B> 

<DD>If specified, <EM>r.neighbors</EM> will run relatively quietly
(i.e., without printing to standard output notes on the program's progress).
If unspecified, the program will print messages to standard output by default.
</DD>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The <EM>r.neighbors</EM> program works in the current geographic region
with the current mask, if any.  It is recommended, but not required,
that the resolution of the geographic region be the same as that
of the raster map layer.  By default, <EM>r.neighbors</EM> will align
these geographic region settings.  However, the user can elect to keep
original input and output resolutions which are not aligned by specifying
this (e.g., using the <EM>-a</EM> option).


<P>

<EM>r.neighbors</EM> copies the GRASS <EM>color</EM> files associated with
the input raster map layer for those output map layers that are based
on the neighborhood average, median, mode, minimum, and maximum.
Because standard deviation, variance, diversity, and interspersion are indices,
rather than direct correspondents to input values,
no <EM>color</EM> files are copied for these map layers.
(The user should note that although the <EM>color</EM> file is copied
for <EM>average</EM>d neighborhood function output,
whether or not the color file makes sense for the output
will be dependent on the input data values.)
