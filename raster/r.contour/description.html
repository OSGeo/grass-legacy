<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.contour</em> produces a GRASS binary vector map of specified contours from GRASS raster map layer.

<OL>
<LI>Contours are produced from a user-specified list of levels.</LI>
<LI>
Contours are produced at some regular increment from user-specified minimum
level to maximum level. If no minimum or maximum level is specified, minimum
or maximum data value will be used.</LI>
</OL>

<H2>
NOTES</H2>
<I>r.contour</I> will either step through incremental contours or produce
contours from a list of levels, not both. If both a list of levels and
a step are specified, the list will be produced and the step will be ignored.


<P>Zero is treated as a valid data value by <I>r.contour</I>.

<P>If a contour level exactly matches a category value in the raster file,
the contour line may backtrack on itself, causing illegal arcs to be produced
in the output GRASS vector file.

<P>The optional <em>cut</em> parameter allows to specify a minimum number of
point for a contour line to be put into output vector map, so that small
spurs, single points and so on won't be present and the output will be more
clear.
