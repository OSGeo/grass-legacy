<h3> Description </h3>
</A> <P>

<em> nviz </em> is meant to be used as a tool for viewing data
surfaces in three dimensions using <strong>GRASS</em></strong> on
<em>Silicon Graphics IRIS</em></strong> computers.  It evolved from
the earlier <strong>GRASS</em><strong> program
<em>SG3d</em></strong>. Users familiar with <em>SG3d</em></strong>
will find <em>nviz</em></strong> similar but with a slightly different
interface and many added features. New features include the ability to
visualize multiple raster, vector, and site files at one time, and the
addition of volume data among others.  Hardware requirements are a
Z-buffer and 24 bit graphics OR a 24 bit graphic emulator, such as
that on the <em>IRIS Indigo</em></strong>.  <p>

<em>nviz</em></strong> uses raster files as "elevation" and also as
attributes of the surfaces (such as color, transparency, etc.).  While
a true elevation data file used as elevation will produce the most
realistic surfaces, users are encouraged to be creative in selecting
other types of data to be represented by the vertical dimension.  Most
continuous (as opposed to discrete) data types will result in a
visualization that makes sense.  While developing the program, we used
chemical concentrations as the elevation file with good visual
results. <p>

Emphasis during development was on ease and speed of viewer
positioning and flexibility for using a wide range of data values and
sizes.  Since a wire grid can be drawn very quickly, such a grid is
used to provide real-time viewer positioning capabilities.  Similarly,
a lighting "model" provides real-time feedback as the user adjusts
lighting.  Grid and polygon resolution control allows the user to
further refine drawing speed and detail as needed.  Continuous scaling
of elevation values from 1.0ee-7 to 1.0ee+7 provides the ability to
use various data types for the vertical dimension. <p>

<A NAME="GeneralP">
<h3> General Notes </h3>
</A> <P>

All <em>nviz</em></strong> windows may be resized using the window
manager's normal controls at any time.  Text in the control panels is
not scalable, however, so the text will disappear if the panel is
sized too small. <p>

Before starting the program, check your current
<strong>GRASS</em></strong> region resolution and dimensions.  The
current resolution will determine the <em>best</em></strong>
resolution available in <em>nviz</em></strong>.  Large dimensions such
as 1000 x 1000 rows and columns may cause the program to run slower.
Try starting out with a smaller (i.e. 300 x 300 or less) region until
you get more comfortable and experienced using the program.  <p>

<A NAME="StartupP">
<h3> Startup </h3>
</A> <P>

The syntax for starting the program is: <p>      

<strong>nviz [-q]
[elevation=</strong><em>name[,name,...]</em><strong>]
[vector=</strong><em>name[,name,...]</em><strong>]
[sites=</strong><em>name[,name,...]</em><strong>]</strong>

<P> <STRONG>-q </STRONG> Quickstart.  Skip over <STRONG>GRASS</STRONG>
parsing and immediately start nviz.

<p> <strong>elevation</strong> (optional) name of a
<strong>GRASS</strong> raster file (or files) to use as elevation

<p> <strong>vector</strong> (optional) name of a
<strong>GRASS</em></strong> vector file (or files).

<p> <strong>sites</strong> (optional) name of a
<strong>GRASS</em></strong> sites list file (or files).
 <P>

If the user types <em>nviz</em></strong> on the command line without
any arguments, the program will prompt the user for the arguments.
<p>

<A NAME="PanelsP">
<h3> Panels </h3>
</A><p>

<em>nviz</em></strong> starts up with one graphics window and one
control panel window.  The top third of the control panel window
contains the <a href="#MovementP"> Movement </a> panel.  Other panels
may be selected from the <em>Panel</em></strong> menu at the top of
the window. When a panel is selected it appears in the control panel
window.  If the window is full, and there is no room for the new
panel, one or more panels that are open on the control panel window
will be closed to make room for the new panel.  Panels can also be
closed using the <em>Close</em></strong> button that appears on each
panel.  The <em>Movement panel</em>, however is always visible. Each
panel from the <em>Panel</em></strong> menu will be described in more
detail below.  <p>

<h3>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/panel/main.gif" ALT = ""> <A name="MovementP">Movement Panel</A>
</h3><p>

Use the <strong>Movement</em></strong> panel to position the viewer
over the data and to indicate viewing direction and perspective.  As
options in this panel are changed, a wire grid of the surface is
redrawn (<em>fast display mode</em></strong>) to immediately show the
results of the changes.  This panel also controls the actual drawing.
 <P>

<DL>
<DT> <B>Auto Clear</B>
<DD> This is a toggle button. If it is enabled
the screen is automatically cleared before surfaces are drawn.  <P>

<DT> <B>Clear</B>
<DD> Clears the screen with the background color.  <P>


<DT> <B>Surface</B>
<DD> Draws loaded surfaces with current drawing
and lighting options.  <P>

<DT> <B>Vectors</B>
<DD> Draws loaded vector files on selected
surfaces.  <P>

<DT> <B>Sites</B>
<DD> Draws loaded site files on selected surfaces.
<P>

<DT> <B>Cancel</B>
<DD> Cancels drawing in progress.  <p>

<DT> <B>XY position</B>
<DD> The <em>XY position</em></strong> box contains a star-shaped puck
which represents the viewer.  Click on the puck and drag to move the
viewer around.  The data may be thought of as always lying in the
center of the box, with north at the top. <p>

<DT> <B>Height</B>
<DD> Adjusts the viewer's height.  <p>

<DT> <B>look here</B>
<DD> Allows the user to click on a spot on the data surface which will
remain centered as the viewer position changes.  After clicking on the
surface, the new center is automatically set and the surface is
redrawn.  <p>

<DT> <B>look center</B>
<DD> Automatically fixes new center of view at the <em>center of the
graphics window</em></strong> (not the center of the data).  <p>

<DT> <B>look cancel</B>
<DD> Clicking on <em>cancel</em></strong> allows the user to move over
the surface with no fixed center of view (default).  <p>

<DT> <B>zexag</B>
<DD> Exaggerates the vertical dimension of the surface.  An
exaggeration of 1.0 represents the surface with x, y, and z units all
being equal.  For example, if the easting and northing units are in
meters and the elevation in feet, a Z exaggeration of .305 would be
the <em>true</em></strong> exaggeration for the surface.  For most
geographical applications, greater than true exaggeration produces
more visually pleasing images.  <p>

<DT> <B>Perspective</B>
<DD> Adjusts the viewer's angle of view.  <p>

<DT> <B>Reset</B>
<DD> Sets all settings to their startup values.  <p>

</DL>
<P>

Occasionally, the bounds of the <B>height</B> slider are too narrow to
position the camera as desired.  In this case, the type-in entry next
to the height slider may be used to set camera height directly.
Typing in a value will also automatically adjust the slider bounds to
account for the new maximum and minimum height.  In general, most
sliders with corresponding type-ins provide this functionality where
it makes sense.  Color sliders, for example, cannot be adjusted since
color components must always be between 0.0 and 1.0.
 <P>

<A NAME="LightHeadP">
<h3> Lights </h3>
</A> <P>

The <A HREF="#LightP">Lights</A> panel contains adjustments and
options to control the position, color and brightness of the lights
and the reflectivity (shininess) of the surface.  There are actually
two lights: one dim white light remains directly above the surface at
all times and serves as fill light. The main light, which the user
controls, is a "local" light which is positioned much like the view
position.  When lights are being adjusted, a sphere appears on the
surface and is continuously redrawn to show the effects of lighting
changes.  The lighting adjustments do not affect the appearance of the
surface until it is redrawn.  Neither light is directional; light is
emitted equally in all directions.  <p>

<h3>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/panel/light.gif"> <A NAME="LightP">Lights Panel</A>
</h3>  <P>

<DL>

<DT> <B>Follow Viewpoint</B>
<DD> By default, the light position is near the viewing position and
the light moves with the viewer.  Toggling this option off will keep
the light fixed in one position as the viewer position changes.
Adjusting the <em>Height</em></strong> or <em>XY
position</em></strong> of the light automatically toggles <em>Follow
Viewpoint</em></strong> off.  <p>

<DT> <B>Show Model</B>
<DD> The sphere showing current lighting effects can be removed by
toggling this option off.  <p>

<DT> <B>Height</B>
<DD> Adjusts light height.  <p>

<DT> <B>XY position</B>
<DD> Adjusts light position over surface; north is always at the top.
<p>

<DT> <B>Light Brightness</B>
<DD> Adjusts the brightness of the light.  <p>

<DT> <B>R, G, B</B>
<DD> Adjusts the Red, Green and Blue components of the main light.
<p>

<DT> <B>Ambient Light</B>
<DD> Adjusts the ambient light associated with the main light and the
brightness of the fill light. <p>

<strong>step, run, Key Frames:</em></strong> The
<em>Frames</em></strong> slider may be thought of as a time line
representing the path.  When a path has been loaded, clicking on
<em>run</em></strong> will move the viewer down the path, redrawing
the wire frame surface at each path step.  The user may cancel a
running animation at any time by clicking on the
<em>stop</em></strong> button.  The <em>Key Frames</em></strong>
slider shows the progression of the animation.  Use the
<em>step</em></strong> arrows to step forward or backward one frame at
a time, or move the <em>Key Frames</em></strong> slider to the desired
point in the animation.  The number to the right of the
<em>step</em></strong> arrows is the frame number being displayed. <p>

<strong>total frames:</em></strong> The value in this type-in box is
the total number of frames in the animation.  When a vector file is
first loaded, the number of points in the file (up to 1000) will be
the number of frames.  Typically, to produce smooth animations, the
user should use a vector file with 10 - 50 points, then change total
frames to 100 or more, depending on the length of the animation
desired. Requesting an excessive number of frames (i.e., 500,000) may
cause memory problems.  <p>

<strong>show path:</em></strong> Toggling this button ON will cause
the path to be drawn each time a new frame is drawn.  The color and
thickness of the path line may be changed using adjustments on the
<strong>Vectors</em></strong> pop up panel.  Showing the path can be
useful while previewing and adjusting the path.  <p>

<strong>show vect:</em></strong> Toggling this button ON will cause
vectors to be drawn each time a new frame is drawn, if a vector file
has been loaded. (see also <em>Vect...</em></strong>).  <p>

<strong>spline, linear, tension:</em></strong> These controls affect
the interpolation method used when the value of <em>total
frames</em></strong> is different than the number of points in the
original vector file used as the path.  The points from the vector
file are always used as control points from which the positioning
information for the total number of requested frames is derived.  If
<em>spline</em></strong> interpolation is selected, the user may
adjust spline tension (how much slack there is in the path) using the
<em>tension</em></strong> slider.  Toggling <em>show
path</em></strong> ON prior to adjusting tension allows the user to
judge how much tension to use for a smoother path.  <p>

<A NAME="Rsavev"></A> <strong>run and save images:</em></strong>
Prompts user in the <strong>GRASS</em></strong> window for a prefix to
be used to name a series of rgb format image files, one for each
frame.  The animation is then run from the beginning, with each frame
being fully rendered using the current display type and resolution
(see <strong><A HREF="#Ctrlp">Control</A></em></strong> panel).  If
<em>show vect</em></strong> is toggled ON, the vector file is also
drawn, then the finished frame is written to an rgb file. If files
already exist with the same name, they are overwritten.  You may
cancel <em>run and save images</em></strong> at any time by selecting
<em>stop</em></strong> This entire process may take several hours of
computer time for a 100 frame animation of a complex surface, but
requires no further intervention from the user.  The finished rendered
animation files can be played back using SGI's <em>movie</em></strong>
program if it is a very short animation or you can capture the images
on video (Also see <em><A HREF="#Idump">Img Dump</A></em></strong>).
<p>

<A NAME="WhatsHeadP">
<H3> What's Here</H3>
</A> <P>

The <A HREF="#WhatsP">What's Here</A> panel operates like the
<strong>GRASS</em></strong> program <em>d.what.rast</em></strong>, you
use the mouse to mark spots on the surface that you would like more
information about.  After clicking on the surface, data prints to the
text box in the panel.  First, the name of the surface clicked on is
printed then the geographical coordinates.  Next, elevation is
bi-linearly interpolated from the current polygon resolution and this
is printed (setting the resolution to 1 will produce the most accurate
elevation). xy distance from previous and xyz distance from previous
are straight line distances, whereas distance along surface and
distance along exag surface are computed as the length of a path
draped across the surface.  Each time you select a point, a marker is
drawn on the surface at the point selected with a line connecting it
to the previous point.  To stop selecting points toggle the
<strong>What's here?</em></strong> button.  <p>

prompts user for a name to be used for an IRIS rgb format image file,
then writes the contents of the graphics window to that file.  This is
basically a screen dump of the portion of the screen defined by the
boundaries of the graphics window, so if any panel windows or windows
from other applications are partially covering the graphics window,
they will appear in the saved image as well.  To view the image files,
you can use the SGI programs <em>ipaste</em></strong> and

<H3>Nviz State</H3>
</A> <P>

It is often desirable and convenient to save some configuration of
Nviz for use in other applications.  For example, each session of Nviz
might require the same set of maps or other attributes.  To allow
persistence between sessions, Nviz provides tools for saving and
loading the current "state" of the system.  These tools are accessed
using the <I>Load State</I> and <I>Save State</I> options under the
<I>File</I> menu.  <P>

<I>Save State</I> records the current status of Nviz, including all
current maps, color settings, camera viewpoint, and so on into a user
designated file.  This state file may then be reloaded at a later time
and will restore the state of Nviz.  <I>Load State</I> queries the
user for a state file to load and modifies the state of Nviz according
to the state file.  Note that <I>Load State</I> does not erase the
current state of Nviz when loading a new state.  Instead, the current
state is augmented according to the contents of the state file.  Since
this can sometimes cause unexpected results, it is best to either
restart Nviz or manually reset the state of Nviz before loading a
state file.  <P>

State files are particularly useful when creating scripts for animation
(see <A HREF="#ScriptingP">scripting</A> below).  In particular, a
predefined Nviz state can be loaded automatically into a script by
turning on scripting and performing the activity of loading the new
state.  <P>

<A NAME="KeyAnimHeadP">
<H3>Key frame Animation</H3>
</A> <P>

The <A HREF="#KeyAnimP">Key frame Animation</A> panel is used to create
more complex animations where careful control of camera motion is
required.  The key frame animator operates using the notion of
<I>channels</I>.  A channel describes some aspect of <I>nviz</I> which
can be changed during an animation.  Channels can be as specific as
necessary, isolating single attributes of <I>nviz</I>, and can be
turned on or off allowing segments of an animation to be arbitrarily
detailed.  <P>

<H3>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/panel/keyanim.gif"><A NAME="KeyAnimP"> Key frame Animation Panel</A>
</H3>

<H4>Channels and Key times</H4>  <P>

As mentioned above, <I>what</I> the key frame animator can control is
determined by channels.  <I>Where</I> the key frame animator creates
changes is determined by key times.  <I>How</I> the key frame animator
creates changes is a more advanced topic and will be discussed later.
For now, we concern ourselves with channels and key times.
<P>

A simple example of an attribute which is controlled by a channel is
the camera.  Although the entire camera could be controlled by a
single channel, doing so would provide too gross a level of control.
Instead, specific aspects of the camera are controlled by a set of
eight channels: <I>FromX</I>, <I>FromY</I>, <I>FromZ</I>, <I>DirX</I>,
<I>DirY</I>, <I>DirZ</I>, <I>FOV</I>, and <I>TWIST</I>.  The
<I>From*</I> channels control the position from which the camera is
looking.  The <I>Dir*</I> attributes control the direction in which
the camera is looking.  Lastly, the <I>FOV</I> and <I>TWIST</I>
attributes control the "field-of-view" and "twist" of the camera.  We
will discuss how channel settings can be used to affect playback
below.
 <P>

For the most part, the key frame animator and the basic animator are
very similar.  One crucial difference is that the key frame animator
uses <I>key times</I> to establish positions of key frames whereas the
basic animator uses frame numbers.  A key time represents a position
in an animation in the form of <I>mm:ss:ff</I> where <I>mm</I> is
minutes, <I>ss</I> is seconds, and <I>ff</I> is frames.  Positioning
key frames using key times is more precise and allows the user to more
accurately design a timed animation.  Moreover, key times do not
depend on the current frame rate (even though you can specify a frame
number as part of a key time).  Key time frame numbers are automatically
adjusted if the user modifies the frame rate.  Thus, the user can
experiment with different frame rates without having to move key frames.
 <P>

Ultimately, the combination of key times and frame rate determines the
overall length of the animation.  If the length of the animation in
key times is <I>m</I> minutes, <I>s</I> seconds and <I>f</I> frames
with a frame rate of <I>v</I>, then the total length of the animation
is <I>(m*60 + s)*v + f</I> frames.  <P>

<H4>Manipulating Key frames</H4> <P>

Key frames are added in the key frame animator in the same fashion that
they are added in the basic animator: move the view to the desired
position and click the <I>Add</I> button.  The position at which the
key frame is added is determined by the <I>New Key Time</I> field.
Normally, all channels are on.  When a key frame is added, the set of
channels are scanned and each channel which is on has its current
status recorded.  Channels which are off do not have their status
recorded.  Key frames are displayed on the white canvas area next to
the list of channels.  The key time for each key frame is given below
the channel sliders.  If a channel has an entry for a key frame, a
light blue rectangle is created in the channel slider.  The list of
channels may be scrolled with the slider on the left.  The bottom
slider scrolls over the length of the animation.  The following figure
shows the key frame area with two key frames.
 <P>

<IMG SRC="nvimg/panel/keyexample.gif"> <P>

The key time display below the channel area is used to move key frames.
To move a key frame, "drag" (i.e. hold the mouse button down while
moving the mouse) the corresponding key time using the first mouse
button.  While you move the mouse, the key time will change to indicate
its new value.  When the value of the key time is correct, release the
first mouse button to place the key frame.  <P>

The second mouse button is used to delete key frames.  To delete a
key frame, select the corresponding key time using the second mouse
button, then click the <I>Delete</I> button.  <I>nviz</I> will ask you
to verify your decision, but once deleted, key frames are not
recoverable.  Note that you may delete more than one key frame at a
time by selecting multiple key times with the second mouse button and
pressing <I>Delete</I>.<P>

<H4>Viewing Animation</H4> <P>

The key frame animator provides facilities for viewing all parts of an
animation as well as tools for running the animation in full rendering
mode and saving the frames to disk.  The primary mechanism for
controlling position within an animation is the current key time
slider.  This slider is represented by a dark blue vertical bar in
each channel slider, and a horizontal key time in large dark letters in
the key time area.  In the figure above, the current key time slider is
positioned at <B>00:00:00</B>.   <P>

The current key time slider may be controlled using either one of the
blue bars in the channels area or its representation in the key time
area.  Within the channel area, simply clicking the first mouse button
at a specified location moves the current key time slider to that
position.  Alternatively, you may drag the slider with the first mouse
button.  Within the key time area, you must drag the current key time
slider to move it.  This is done by holding down the first mouse
button over the large dark key time and moving the mouse.  Releasing
the first mouse button sets the position.  While dragging in either
area, the key time display updates itself to show the current position.
<P>

The tape player controls at the top of the panel can be used to view a
running animation.  The direction of the arrows on four of the buttons
indicate which direction the animation will play when they a pressed.
Arrow buttons with a vertical bar will step a single frame whereas
plain arrow buttons will play the animation until an endpoint is
reached or the stop button is pressed (the square button).  The
animation is always played using the current frame rate setting.  You
can use the <I>Frame rate</I> button to change frame rate and experiment
a bit.  <P>

The final step in developing an animation is usually saving the frame
sequence to disk.  In the key frame animator, the <I>Run and Save
Images</I> button does just that.  Pressing this button creates a
Popup which queries the user for a base file name and a rendering
style.  The rendering style may either be wire frame (fastest) or full
rendering (slowest).  The base file name is used to store frames to
disk in the form <I>base_nameXXXXX.rgb</I> where <I>XXXXX</I> is the
frame number.  Pressing <I>Ok</I> on the popup will start the
rendering.  You may stop the rendering by pressing the stop tape
button as described above.  <P>

<H4>Advanced Topic: Adding Your Own Channels</H4> <P>

The channels <I>nviz</I> adds by default to the key frame animator are
rather limited.  However, the key frame animator is sophisticated
enough to handle more general behavior.  In particular, it is possible
(with a little minor programming) for the user to add their own
channels.  The actual mechanism by which channels operate is a bit
complex but necessary to understand in order to take advantage of all
the features of the key frame animator.  During playback, each channel
determines a value for the attribute it controls.  Thus the <I>FOV</I>
channel is responsible for determining the Camera's "field-of-view"
setting during animation playback.  They way channels set values for
attributes is by <I>interpolating</I> between key frame settings.  The
fact that not all channels may have entries for every key frame means
that interpolation may be different for each channel.  This is where
the key frame animator gains its flexibility. <P>

What follows is a brief discussion describing key framing in the
key frame animator, and an explicit example of adding a channel.  Using
the example given here as a template, it should be fairly easy for
users to add their own channels.  <P>

<H5>Introduction</H5>  <P>

The purpose of this section is to provide instructions for adding
animation capability to the key frame animator in nviz.  The key frame
animator records the state of various "channels" each time a key frame
is added.  Frames falling in between key frames are interpolated based
on the channel entries at bounding key frames.  The interpolation can
either be static (that is, no interpolation) to handle changes in, for
example, file names, colors, etc., or interpolation can be dynamic
meaning a linear interpolation of floating point values.  Key framing
and channel addition is discussed below.  <P>

<H5>Key framing</H5>  <P>

Key framing is an animation technique where we record the state of nviz
at crucial moments (called key frames) and interpolate between these
events to create individual animation frames.  Key framing under nviz
is based on channels.  A channel specifies one aspect of nviz which
may be altered at each key frame.  Nviz starts out with a default set
of channels which govern camera position.  The user is then free to
add other channels as described below.  <P>

Separating the state of nviz into channels allows different aspects of
nviz to have different animation characteristics.  Each channel may be
set either active or inactive at a specific key frame.  If a channel is
active then it specifies a change at that key frame.  Otherwise, the
state of the channel is interpolated between the two closest enclosing
key frames.  As an example, suppose we have six key frames as follows:  <P>

<PRE>
Camera         X----------X----I-----X-----J----X----------X----K-----X
                               I           J                    K
Cutplane0                 X----I-----X-----J---------------X    K
                               I           J                    K
Keyframe       1          2    I     3     J    4          5    K     6
</PRE>  <P>

The X's specify where a channel is active.  Thus, the camera is active
at every key frame while cutplane0 is only active at key frames 2, 3 and
5.  The columns of I's, J's and K's indicate the position of animation
frames.  Now, at frame I, both camera and cutplane0 attributes are
interpolated from their associated entries in key frames 2 and 3.  At
frame J, however, camera attributes are interpolated from key frames 3
and 4, while cutplane0 attributes are interpolated from key frames 3
and 5.  Finally, at frame K, camera attributes are interpolated from
key frames 5 and 6, while no changes are made to cutplane0.  Thus by
changing what channels are active, we may specify different
interpolation rates for different channels.  <P>

<H5>Adding Channels</H5>  <P>

Channels may be added to the key frame animator by calling the function
keyanimAddChannel.  keyanimAddChannel requires four arguments:  <P>

<OL>
<LI> BASE name of kanimator panel
<UL> 
<LI> Use the tcl/tk path of the animator panel in your version of nviz
</UL>
<LI> Channel Name
<UL>
<LI> Specify a single word, unique name for your channel
</UL>
<LI> Entry List
<UL>
<LI> Specify a list describing entries this channel will control, more on this below
</UL>
<LI> Get Function 
<UL>
<LI> Specify a function which takes no arguments and returns a list of entries as described in the entry list
</UL>
<LI> Set Function
<UL>
<LI> Specify a function that, when given a list of entries as
described in the entry list, will change the state of nviz as specified by the entry list
</UL>
</OL>
 <P>

The BASE name of the key frame animator panel is
$Nv_(P_AREA).kanimator by default.  Also, be sure to specify a
<B>one</B> word, <B>unique</B> name for the channel so there is no
danger of interfering with existing channels.  <P>

<H5>Entry Lists</H5> <P>

An entry list is used to describe to the animator a list of values
that a channel will govern.  An entry list is a list of pairs where
each pair specifies an entry name and an interpolation type.
 <P>

As an example, consider a channel called "cplane-0" (cutplane 0).
There are six attributes we need to keep track of for the cplane-0
panel: the x, y, and z components of translation, the blend type, the
rotation angle, and the tilt angle.  This corresponds to the following
entry list:
 <P>

<PRE>
{{pos_x dynamic} {pos_y dynamic} {pos_z dynamic} 
 {blend_type static} {rot dynamic} {tilt dynamic}}
</PRE> <P>

Note that blend type is interpolated statically because blend type is
not a floating point value, but rather a text string (and it makes no
sense to linearly interpolate a text string).
 <P>

<H5>Get Functions</H5> <P>

As mentioned earlier, the get function returns the current state of
the channel it is associated with.  keyanimAddChannel expects the get
function to return a list in the same format as the entry list except
that interpolation types will be replaced with actual values.  Getting
back to our cutplane example, we need to define a function which
returns a translation positions, blend type, and rotation and tilt
positions.  One possible tcl/tk function would be:
 <P>

<PRE>
proc cutplane0_get_entries {} {
  global Nv_

  # Assemble the entry list showing the current state of cutplane 0
  set ret [list]
	
  foreach i [list pos_x pos_y pos_z blend_type rot tilt] {
    set val [list $i]

    switch $i {
      "pos_x"      { lappend val [lindex [Ncutplane0 get_trans] 0] }
      "pos_y"      { lappend val [lindex [Ncutplane0 get_trans] 1] }
      "pos_z"      { lappend val [lindex [Ncutplane0 get_trans] 2] }
      "blend_type" { lappend val $Nv_(CutPlaneFence) }
      "rot"        { lappend val [lindex [Ncutplane0 get_rot] 2] }
      "tilt"       { lappend val [lindex [Ncutplane0 get_rot] 1] }
    }

    lappend ret $val
  }

  return $ret
}
</PRE> <P>

Here we run through the list of entries for the cplane-0 channel and
make the appropriate library calls to get the status of cutplane 0.
The list returned has exactly the same form as the entry list except
that interpolation types are replaced by actual values.
 <P>

<H5>Set Functions</H5> <P>

The set function is required to take as argument a list of the form
returned by the get function.  That is, an entry list with
interpolation types replaced by actual values.  Note that the argument
list may not contain all the entries for a channel.  In particular,
entries for statically interpolated channel attributes will only be
included in this list at key frames.  One possible tcl/tk set function
for cplane-0 would be:
 <P>

<PRE>
proc cutplane0_set_entries { elist } {
  global Nv_

  set cur_trans [Ncutplane0 get_trans]
  set old_trans $cur_trans
  set cur_rot   [Ncutplane0 get_rot]
  set old_rot $cur_rot
  set cur_blend $Nv_(CutPlaneFence)
  set old_blend $cur_blend

  foreach i $elist {
    switch [lindex $i 0] {
      "pos_x"      { set cur_trans [lreplace $cur_trans 0 0 [lindex $i 1]] }
      "pos_y"      { set cur_trans [lreplace $cur_trans 1 1 [lindex $i 1]] }
      "pos_z"      { set cur_trans [lreplace $cur_trans 2 2 [lindex $i 1]] }
      "blend_type" { set cur_blend [lindex $i 1] }
      "rot"        { set cur_rot [lreplace $cur_rot 2 2 [lindex $i 1]] }
      "tilt"       { set cur_rot [lreplace $cur_rot 1 1 [lindex $i 1]] }
    }
  }

  if {"$cur_trans" != "$old_trans"} then {
    Ncutplane0 set_trans [lindex $cur_trans 0] [lindex $cur_trans 1] [lindex $cur_trans 2]
  }

  if {"$cur_rot" != "$old_rot"} then {
    Ncutplane0 set_rot [lindex $cur_rot 0] [lindex $cur_rot 1] [lindex $cur_rot 2]
  }

  if {"$cur_blend" != "$old_blend"} then {
    set Nv_(CutPlaneFence) $cur_blend
    Nset_fence_color $cur_blend
  }
}
</PRE> <P>

<H5>Notes</H5> <P>

The last task is to actually make the call which adds the channel.
For the cut plane example above, we make the following call to
keyanimAddChannel:  <P>

<PRE>
set entry_list [list [list pos_x dynamic] [list pos_y dynamic] [list pos_z dynamic]]
lappend entry_list [list blend_type static]
lappend entry_list [list rot dynamic] [list tilt dynamic]

keyanimAddChannel $Nv_(P_AREA).kanimator "cplane-0" $entry_list \
    cutplane0_get_entries cutplane0_set_entries
</PRE> <P>

The cutplane-0 implementation given above is the same as that used
for the cplane-0 channel given in <I>nviz</I>.  <P>

<A NAME="ScriptingP">
<H3>Scripting</H3>
</A> <P>

<H4>Introduction</H4> <P>

Sometimes it is desirable to automatically generate arbitrarily
complicated changes to Nviz when creating an animation.  The tools
presented so far allow the user to create camera movement as well as
add custom animation channels (e.g. the cut plane channel) to the
key frame animator.  However, the user would be required to add several
complex channels to the key frame animator to capture the most general
behavior.  The purpose of the scripting environment is to allow the
user to develop a one-time script file which can handle arbitrarily
complex changes to the Nviz environment.  Script files are extremely
application dependent and, in general, will not be usable with other
applications.  However, they are the most convenient mechanism for
capturing specific behavior quickly.  <P>

Scripting is controlled by the commands provided in the scripting
pulldown menu (see <A HREF="#ScriptPulldown">figure</A> below).  By
default, when scripting has been activated every user event in Nviz is
recorded and output to a script saved as a text file.  This script
file may be played back in Nviz by using the <I>Play Script</I> option
in the menu.  Thus, most scripts are simply a carbon copy of the user
performing certain actions.  Scripting can become more powerful,
however, by adding loops around a sequence of script events, or by
using higher-level tools.  The more advanced features of scripting are
described in the <A HREF="#ScriptTools">Script Tools</A> section below.
The next section is devoted to describing basic scripting.  Be sure to
read this section carefully as the discussion of advanced features
assumes the knowledge of this material.
<P>

<H3>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/script_pulldown.gif">
<A NAME="ScriptPulldown"> Script Pulldown Menu</A>
</H3>

<H4>Basic Scripting</H4> <P>

Basic scripting entails designating a script file, turning scripting
on and off, and sending commands directly to the script.  Before doing
anything with scripting it is necessary to designate a script file.
This is done by selecting the <I>Scriptfile</I> option in the script
pulldown menu.  The user is queried for a file to use as the new
script file.  If the designated file already exists then scripting
will overwrite the old contents of the file.
<P>

Once a script file has been selected, scripting is turned on and off by
selecting the <I>On</I> radio button in the scripting menu.  The status
of this radio button indicates whether or not scripting is active.  As
soon as scripting becomes active, literally everything the user does
is recorded in the script file.  Since this can lead to extremely large
script files, it is suggested that scripting be turned on only when the
next few user events are critical to the script.  When you are
finished adding commands to the script, select <I>Close Script</I> to
close the script file.
<P>

To make the script files somewhat more legible and useful, two
additional commands are available in basic scripting: <I>Add Script
Line</I> and <I>Add Script Cmd</I>.  The difference between these two
commands is subtle but important.  We will delay a discussion of the
differences between these two commands for now.  For our purposes, the
difference between these two commands is as follows: <I>Add Script
Line</I> adds a command directly to the script being written and will
not affect the state of Nviz; <I>Add Script Cmd</I> adds a command to
the script which <B>will</B> affect the state of Nviz.  A script in
Nviz is really a Tcl script with a slightly specialized format.
Hence, legal script commands are things like comments marked with the
<B>#</B> character, expressions like <B>set i [expr $i + 1]</B>, and
so on.  <I>Add Script Line</I> is intended to add commands which
directly affect the Tcl code in the script.  Thus comments can be
added making scripts more readable, variables may be accessed, and
conditionals may be inserted allowing the script to select different
execution paths depending on script variables.  Commands added by
<I>Add Script Cmd</I> may also be Tcl commands.  However, these
commands are executed directly in the Nviz environment and affect the
current state of Nviz directly (but <B>do not</B> affect the state of
the script).  Thus commands like <B>Nsurf10001 set_att topo
y90o.1</B>, which will set the topology attribute of a particular
surface to a particular file, are meaningful commands to add.
 <P>

The combination of <I>Add Script Line</I> and <I>Add Script Cmd</I>
provide the most general tools for controlling script files short of
directly editing the text of a script.  It is expected that these
commands will rarely be used.  However, <I>Add Script Line</I> in
particular is useful for placing comments to separate distinct
portions of a script and make the overall script file more readable.
 <P>

<H4>
<A NAME="ScriptTools">Script Tools</A>
</H4>
 <P>

The <I>Script Tools</I> menu selection pops up the script tools menu
which provides higher level script manipulation facilities.  It is
possible to do everything a script tool does by using <I>Add Script
Line</I> and <I>Add Script Cmd</I> described above.  However, the
script tools are much more convenient and should be used instead.
Currently, there are three types of tool covering the five selections
in the script tool popup.  <I>Open Loop</I> and <I>Close Loop</I>
allow iteration using a numeric loop variable.  <I>Open File
Seq. Loop</I> and <I>Close File Seq. Loop</I> allow iteration over a
series of files.  Finally, the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> allows very
general iteration over a variety of attributes associated with
surface, vector and site maps.  Be sure that scripting has been turned
on (by selecting <I>On</I>) before using a script tool.  The <I>File
Sequence Tool</I> does not necessarily require scripting to be on, but
for now we assume scripting has been activated.
<P>

<H5><I>Open and Close Loop</I></H5> <P>

The simplest tool is the <I>Open/Close Loop</I> pair.  This tool
defines a loop variable given the name <B>lpX</B> where X is the
current loop being defined (starting with 1).  The loop variable is
iterated over a numeric range as specified by the user.  The user may
add commands (using <I>Add Script Line</I>) which reference the loop
variable.  The most general functionality provided by this tool is the
ability to repeat some script activity a specified number of times.
<P>

A simple <I>Open/Close Loop</I> is created as follows:
<UL>
<LI> Select <I>Open Loop</I> from the script tools menu.
<LI> Fill in numeric values for "Loop Start Value", "Loop End Value"
and "Loop Increment Value" in the resulting popup (see <A HREF="#SimpLoopP">
figure</A> below), and press "Accept".
<LI> Continue scripting as usual adding all activities over which you
wish to iterate.
<LI> Close the loop by selecting <I>Close Loop</I> from the script
tools menu.
</UL>
 <P>

<H5>
<A NAME="SimpLoopP">
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/SimpLoop.gif"> Simple Loop Popup
</A>
</H5> <P>

Note that simple loops may be nested by repeating the above process
from within a simple loop.  Each additional loop uses the same naming
scheme, thus the outer loop will be <B>lp1</B>, the first nested loop
is <B>lp2</B> and so on.  Internally a stack of loop names is
maintained so that selecting <I>Close Loop</I> closes the most
recently opened loop.
 <P>

<H5><I>Open and Close File Seq. Loop</I></H5> <P>

Simple open/close loops work well when looping behavior is relatively
simple.  However, simple loops are restricted to iterating over
numeric values.  A common scenario is for some map object in the scene
to display a sequence of map files.  That is, we need to be able to
iterate over lists of files.  The <I>Open/Close File Seq. Loop</I>
pair provide this functionality.  This tool, when activated, forces
any mapBrowser activities within the scope of the loop to use the
current loop iteration value rather than the value entered by the user
when the script is created.  Creating a file loop is slightly awkward
but follows these basic steps:

<UL>
<LI> Select <I>Open File Seq. Loop</I> from the script tools menu.
<LI> Select a sequence of files using the Map Browser tool (see
<A HREF="#FBrowseP">figure</A> below), and press "Done".
<LI> Continue scripting as usual adding all activities over which you
wish to iterate.
<LI> If you wish to apply the file sequence to a particular map,
modify the appropriate map as if you were loading a file from the file
sequence (see the <A HREF="#FileSeqEx">example</A> below).
<LI> Close the loop by selecting <I>Close File Seq. Loop</I> from the
script tools menu.
</UL>
 <P>

<H5>
<A NAME="FBrowseP">
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/FBrowse.gif"> File Sequence Loop Popup
</A>
</H5>
 <P>

Like simple loops, file sequence loops may be nested as well as mixed
with simple loops (make sure that you use the appropriate "Close"
button however!).  File sequence loops use a naming scheme similar to
simple loops.  File sequence iteration values can be accessed using
the variable <B>lseqX</B> where X starts at 1 for the first loop and
increments by 2 for consecutive loops (thus the next loop is 3, then
5, and so on).  <P>

To help clarify how the file sequence loop value can automatically be
used by map browser activities, consider the following explicit
example:
 <P>

<A NAME="FileSeqEx"></A>
Suppose we want the topology of a surface map to sequence over a list
of files (for example, the four file sequence shown in the map browser
image above).  We can use the file sequence loop tool to do this as
follows: 
<OL>
<LI> Turn on scripting as usual.
<LI> Set up the state of Nviz just prior to iterating over the list of
files.  This includes loading the surface we wish to modify during
the loop. 
<LI> Open the file sequence loop with <I>Open File Seq. Loop</I>.
<LI> Select the list of files we wish to iterate over as above.
<LI> Load some arbitrary file into the topology attribute of the
surface we wish to modify in the loop.
<LI> Close the file sequence loop with <I>Close File Seq. Loop</I>.
</OL>
 <P>

When the script event corresponding to changing topology (step 5
above) is replayed in Nviz, the current value of the file sequence
loop is used instead of the value supplied during script creation.
Thus, during each iteration of the loop the topology attribute is set
to the current value of the file sequence loop.
 <P>

Be aware that the file sequence loop affects <B>all</B> map browser
activities within the scope of the loop.  Thus <B>any</B> script
events added within the scope of a loop which also require a map
browser will have their value replaced during script playback with the
current value of the file loop.  
 <P>

<H5><I>File Sequence Tool</I></H5> <P>

<H5><B>Introduction</B></H5> <P>

The final script tool, the <I>File Sequence Tool</I>, is the most
complicated but also the most flexible.  This tool is designed to
allow iteration over several attributes of several maps in Nviz.
Unlike the two previous tools, the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> is
capable of automatically producing a stand-alone script file which can
be played back within Nviz.  <P>

Creating a script using the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> consists of two
major steps: creating a state file, and creating a file sequence.
State files were discussed in the appropriate section above.  For the
purposes of scripting, the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> can use a state
file as a basis for the script it creates.  Usually, the user sets up
Nviz in a configuration just prior to the beginning of file iteration
and saves the state of Nviz.  The script created by the <I>File
Sequence Tool</I> can then load this state file automatically before
performing file iteration.  The <A HREF="#FSToolEx">example</A> below
should help clarify these activities.  For now, let us take a detailed
look at the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> control window. <P>

The <I>File Sequence Tool</I> control window is activated by selecting
<I>File Sequence Tool</I> from the script tools popup:
 <P>

<H5>
<A NAME="FSToolImg"></A>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/FSTool.gif"> File Sequence Tool Window
</H5>
 <P>

The <I>File Sequence Tool</I> operates on the concept of
<B>fields</B>.  A field identifies some attribute of a surface,
vector, or site map which will be modified during an animation.  The
lower area of the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> is used to display all the
fields currently set.  In the example above, a single field is defined
which modifies the topography attribute of a surface in Nviz.  The
buttons under <I>Fields:</I> are used to manipulate the current list
of fields.  Pressing <I>Add</I> will create a new field.  Pressing
<I>Delete</I> will allow the user to delete one of the fields.  The
<I>State:</I> button is used to determine the state file which the
current fields will use a basis for script creation.
 <P>

Before we discuss how to add fields, it is important to understand
what types of fields may be added and how they may be changed.  As
mentioned before, a field identifies some attribute of a surface,
vector or site map that we wish to change during each frame of an
animation.  For surfaces, we can modify the attributes topography,
color, mask, transparency, shininess, and emission.  For vectors and
sites, we can only modify the current file.  Furthermore, there are at
least three simple ways we can change a field inbetween frames: we can
load a new file in the place of the current file; we can <I>unset</I>
the field so that it has no value; and we can leave the field
unchanged.  The <I>File Sequence Tool</I> supports all of the
attributes we have listed plus the three simplest ways of changing
these attributes inbetween frames.  
 <P>

<H5><B>Adding Fields</B></H5> <P>

Adding a field is a two step process: the user must decide which
attribute of which surface, vector or site to modify; and the user
must specify the list of changes to the selected attribute.  Pressing
the <I>Add</I> button creates the following popup:
 <P>

<H5>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/AddField.gif">
Add Button Popup</H5> <P>

<I>Field Type:</I> refers to the type of map object this field will
modify.  Valid selections are <I>Surface</I>, <I>Vector</I> or
<I>Site</I>.  <I>Field Attribute:</I> refers to what attribute of the
given type the new field will modify.  For surfaces, valid selections
are <I>Topography</I>, <I>Color</I>, <I>Mask</I>, <I>Transparency</I>,
<I>Shininess</I>, and <I>Emission</I>.  For vectors or sites, the only
valid selections is <I>File</I>.  <I>Set From:</I> refers to a
surface, vector or site file in the <B>current</B> session of Nviz
which will be used as the placeholder for changes in the new field.
When a script is created, the <I>Set From</I> map object has the
specified attribute changed according to the new field.  Thus, the
<I>Set From</I> map object should also be stored in the state file
used by this file sequence.
 <P>

After selecting an appropriate type, attribute and source map object,
clicking <I>Accept</I> creates the file browser popup:
 <P>

<H5>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/FSToolBrowse.gif">
Field File List Popup</H5> <P>

Normally, the file browser will have no selected files.  However, for
the sake of illustration we have already selected a few files in the
image above.  The <B>MAPSETS</B> and <B>FILES</B> lists operate just
as in the <I>Open/Close File Seq. Loop</I> tool above.  When a file is
selected, its name is copied to the file list on the far right.  File
names may be entered explicitly in the type-in field on the top.  The
list of files on the far right indicates the sequence of changes the
current field will undergo when a script is created.  Recall that the
<I>File Sequence Tool</I> supports three mechanisms for changing a
field between frames: load a new file, unset the field, or leave the
field alone.  Selecting a file from the <B>FILES</B> list corresponds
to loading a new file inbetween frames.  By pressing the <I>Blank</I>
button, the field is directed to unset the field for the next frame.
This is indicated by storing <I>-- blank --</I> as the next file in
the file list.  By pressing the <I>Previous</I> button, the field is
directed to make no changes to the field and use the setting for the
previous frame.  This is indicated by storing <I>(NO CHANGE) ***</I>
where <I>***</I> is the previous entry in the file list.
 <P>

For example, in the image above the file list changes can be described
as follows:
<OL>
<LI> <I>a1.masked@helena</I> is loaded.
<LI> Nothing is changed for frame 2.
<LI> The current field is <I>unset</I> and will not be displayed.
<LI> <I>a3.masked@helena</I> is loaded.
<LI> <I>as.2m100@helena</I> is loaded.
</OL>
 <P>

The <I>Remove</I> button removes the selected file entry from the file
list.  The <I>Done</I> button is used to indicate that you are
finished creating the file sequence for the current field.  Clicking
<I>Cancel</I> will backup to the <I>Add Button Popup</I>.  Clicking
<I>Cancel</I> on the <I>Add Button Popup</I> will cancel the creation
of a new field.
 <P>

The file sequence for a particular field may be changed even after it
has been added to the field list.  Each field in the <I>File Sequence
Tool Window</I> contains a button which indicates the type of map
object this field modifies (see the <A HREF="#FSToolImg">image</A>
above).  Clicking this button pops up the file browser as above except
that the list of files is initialized to the current file list for the
selected field.
 <P>

<H5><B>Saving Fields</B></H5> <P>

A particular configuration of fields can be saved for later editing by
using the <I>Load Fields...</I> and <I>Save Fields...</I> options
under the <I>Options:</I> heading.  <I>Save Fields...</I> will save
all of the current field configurations plus the name of the
associated state file for later user.  Conversely, <I>Load
Fields...</I> will load a configuration of fields.  Note that, in
order to edit a group of fields in a different Nviz session, it will
be necessary to re-load the state of Nviz that existed when the
original fields were created.  This is necessary so that the map
objects which the original fields referenced will be present in the
system if these fields are changed.
 <P>

<H5><B>Building a Script</B></H5> <P>

Once the user has created all the necessary fields for a particular
script, it is possible to create a playable script file.  There are
two ways script information can be created: script information can be
written to a script currently being created, or a separate,
stand-alone script can be created.  In either case, the script code
created will only create the changes indicated by the given fields
over the given number of frames.  Extra code, such as code necessary
for rendering and saving images after each frame, must be added
separately.  Since adding image saving code is a frequent activity, a
comment is added to the code produced by the <I>File Sequence Tool</I>
to aid the user in determining where to add code.
 <P>

Clicking <I>Add To Script</I> will add code to the current active
script which will invoke the changes indicated by the field files.
Make sure that scripting has been turned on (see above) before using
this option.
 <P>

Clicking <I>Build Script...</I> will build a stand-alone script file.
Stand-alone scripts first load the state file, then the field changes
are executed as specified by the field descriptions.  As usual, code
must be added to the script to render images and save them to files.
 <P>

<H5><B>Example</B></H5> <P>

The following step-by-step example should help clarify the creation of
a script using the <I>File Sequence Tool</I>.
 <P>

<!-- Create an example of file tool scripting here -->
<A NAME="FSToolEx"></A>

For this example, we will specify one surface with a vector and site
file overlayed on top of it.  At each frame, we will change the
topography and color attributes of the surface, and the overlay files
for the sites map.  This animation will be a stand-alone animation.
Recall that creating an animation with the <I>File Seq. Tool</I>
requires two major steps: creating a state file and creating the field
specifications.  Since we will need all the appropriate maps loaded
into Nviz before we can create the field specifications, we will go
ahead and create the state file first:
 <P>

<OL>
<LI> Start up Nviz with "nviz -q".
<LI> Add the surface "y90o.1@helena" by pressing <I>New</I> on the
surface panel.
<LI> Position the camera so that the surface is in full view.
<LI> Add the vector map "shore.ascii@helena" by pressing <I>New</I> on
the vector panel.
<LI> Set the vector map so that it overlays the surface we added in
step 2 above.
<LI> Add the sites map "y90mo.1@helena" by pressing <I>New</I> on the
sites panel.
<LI> Set the sites map so that it overlays the surface we added in step
2 above.
<LI> Set an appropriate size for the sites map.
<LI> Save the state of Nviz by selecting <I>Save State...</I> from the
<I>File</I> menu and choosing an appropriate name.
</OL>
 <P>

At this point, we have established the state of Nviz before our
animation will begin.  State files provide a convenient encapsulation
of the state of Nviz just prior to beginning animation.  In fact, we
may alter state files independently of the scripts which require them
as long as we do not change the map objects required by each script.
This allows users to modify such features as colors, positioning, line
sizes, lighting, etc. without having to remake scripts.
 <P>

The next step is to set up the frame changes for the animation.  We
will require three fields: one to modify surface topography, one to
modify surface color, and one to modify the sites source file.  For
the sake of brevity, our animation will only be five frames long.  We
can create the field changes as follows:
 <P>

<OL>
<LI> Load the script tools by selecting <I>Script Tools</I> under the
<I>Scripting</I> menu.
<LI> Press the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> button on the script tools
popup.
<LI> Press the <I>Add</I> button under <I>Fields:</I> in the <I>File
Sequence Tool</I>.
<LI> Be sure that <I>Field Type:</I> is set to <I>Surface</I>,
<I>Field Attribute:</I> is set to <I>Topography</I> and <I>Set
From:</I> is set to "y90o.1@helena", then press <I>Accept</I>.
<LI> In the file browser popup, select the sequence of files:
<UL>
<LI> y90o.1@helena
<LI> y90o.2@helena
<LI> y90o.3@helena
<LI> y90o.4@helena
<LI> y90o.5@helena
</UL>
and click <I>Done</I>.
<LI> We have just created the five frame changes for the topography
attribute.  Repeat steps 4 and 5 except set <I>Field Attribute:</I> to
<I>Color</I>.  This creates the five frame changes for the color attribute.
<LI> Repeat steps 4 and 5 except set <I>Field Type:</I> to <I>Site</I>.
In the file browser popup , select the sequence of files:
<UL>
<LI> y90mo.1@helena
<LI> y90mo.2@helena
<LI> y90mo.3@helena
<LI> y90mo.4@helena
<LI> y90mo.5@helena
</UL>
<LI> Finally, set the state file to the file you saved in state
creation above.  State file is set by pressing the <I>State File:</I>
button under <I>Fields:</I>.
</OL>
 <P>

At this point, the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> display should look
something like the following:
 <P>

<H5>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/FSToolExample.gif">
File Sequence Tool Example</H5>
 <P>

It may be wise to save your progress up to this point by clicking
<I>Save Fields...</I> and choosing an appropriate file name.  Saving
the fields configuration is also a convenient way to use the same
state file with different fields settings.  For example, we could
later modify our fields settings above by changing the list of files
used in the frame sequence, adding new fields, etc.
 <P>

Since we are generating a stand-alone script, press the <I>Build
Script...</I> button and choose an appropriate file name for the new
script.  We will now edit the script so that it will render each frame
after the field changes have been made.  Load the script file into
your favorite editor and do the following:
 <P>

<OL>
<LI> Find the line with the comment "# Put image saving code here".
It is after this line that we will add commands to render frames.
<LI> Add the following four lines after the comment <B>exactly</B> as
they appear here:
<PRE>
     SendScriptLine "Nsurf_draw_all"
     SendScriptLine "Nvect_draw_all"
     SendScriptLine "Nsite_draw_all"
     after 1000
</PRE>
<LI> Re-save the script file.
</OL>
 <P>

The four lines we have added are instructions to Nviz to render the
all surface, vector and site files, then wait approximately one second
before going on to the next frame.  The <I>SendScriptLine</I> command
is described in the next section.  At this point, the script is purely
stand-alone and can be played from within nviz.  To play the script
select <I>Play Script</I> from the <I>Scripting</I> menu and choose
the script file you saved above.  After a brief bit of initialization,
the script will execute the field changes we specified above.

<A NAME="HintsP">

<H3>General</H3> <P>

One nifty trick for navigating around Nviz is the "paste" feature
supported in Tcl/Tk menus.  Any pulldown menu may be pasted
permanently on the screen by selecting the menu using the middle mouse
button (as opposed to the first mouse button).  The user may then
click and drag the menu to another location on the screen.  The menu
will remain in its new position, regardless of the selections made
from it, until the menu item which created the pulldown is selected
using the first mouse button.  For example, you can keep the "Panel"
menu up for the duration of an Nviz session by selecting "Panel" from
the main menu using the middle mouse button.  Selecting "Panel" with
the first mouse button moves the pasted menu back to its normal
position and removes the menu after a selection has been made.
<P>

<h3> Lighting </h3><p>

Lighting greatly enhances the level of detail that can be seen in the
surface.  For good lighting effects, position the light so that it
creates a tilted half-moon on the sphere.  Usually placing the light
in the N-W corner when viewing from the south works well because of
the way humans tend to interpret shading.  To reveal very subtle
gradual elevation changes, experiment with light placement and surface
reflectivity.  Keep resolution higher (3 or 4) while adjusting viewing
position and lighting so that drawing time is fast.  Then lower
polygon resolution to 1 or 2 for the final rendering of the surface.
<p>

When rendering frames for animation, it is usually better to position
lights so that they do not move with the viewer position (toggle
<em>Follow Viewpoint</em></strong> OFF).  <p>

<h3> <A NAME="Hanim">Animation</A> </h3><p>

What follows is an example of creating an animation to help you get
started.  <p>

<h4> Key frames </h4><p>

Using key frames is one of the easiest methods of animation it just
takes some getting use to the <em>Key Frame</em></strong> slider.  For
practice, just try making a circular path while always looking at the
center of the data: <p>

<OL> 

<LI> use <em>look here</em></strong> to mark a fixed center of view in
the middle of the surface. <p>


<LI> move the puck in the <em>XY position</em></strong> box to the
southeast corner, adjust <em>Height</em></strong> and
<em>Perspective</em></strong> until the data surface fills your
graphics window.  <p>


<LI> pop up the <strong>Keyframe</em></strong> panel.  <p>

<LI> Click on <em>add a key frame</em></strong>.  <p>

<LI> position the <em>Key Frame</em></strong> slider bar to the next
place to add a key frame by clicking a half inch or so farther along
the slider.  <p>

<LI> move the <em>XY position</em></strong> puck to the northeast
corner.  <p>

<LI> Click on <em>add a key frame</em></strong> and repeat step 5.  <p>

<LI> move the <em>XY position</em></strong> puck to the northwest
corner.  <p>


<LI> Click on <em>add a key frame</em></strong>.  <p>

You should now have enough key frames marked to define a path, so try
clicking on <em>show path</em></strong> and then <em>run</em></strong>
(NOT <em>run and save images</em></strong>).  If nothing happens,
clear all key frames and go back to step 1.  Now let's complete the
circular path: <p>

<LI> repeat step 5.  <p>

<LI> move the <em>XY position</em></strong> puck to the southwest
corner.  <p>

<LI> Click on <em>add a key frame</em></strong>.  <p>

<LI> Now to close the loop, move the <em>Key Frames</em></strong>
slider down to frame 1, so that the first frame is displayed, release
the mouse button, then click once on the slider in the empty part,
past the last key frame, and click on <em>add a key frame</em></strong>.
This essentially copies the first key frame to the fifth &amp; last
key frame.  <p>

</OL>

Now click on <em>run</em></strong>.  When the animation stops, adjust
the spline tension or use linear interpolation, change the number of
total frames, and run again.  If you wanted to render the animated
frames to .rgb files, you would now toggle <em>show path</em></strong>
OFF and click on <em>run and save images</em></strong>, but why not
wait until you get a little more creative - image files use a lot of
disk space.  <p>

<strong>Changing key frames:</em></strong> With the above key frames
loaded, try changing a key frame as follows: <p>

<OL>

<LI> Position the <em>Key Frames</em></strong> slider so that it
aligns with the arrow marking the second key frame.  <p>

<LI> Using the <em>Height</em></strong> adjustment in the
<strong>Movement</em></strong> panel, raise your viewing position.
Notice that if you have <em>show path</em></strong> toggled ON, you
can see how your viewing position changes relative to the defined path
by watching the south or east path views.  The small red dot
represents your current position.  <p>

<LI> Click on <em>add a key frame</em></strong>.  You will be asked in
dialog box if you want to replace the old key frame:click <em>ok
</em></strong>.  <p>

<LI> Run the animation again to see how the path has changed.  <p>

<LI> Delete the middle key frame: grab its arrow marker (using your
left mouse button), drag the marker completely off the slider to the
garbage can icon at right, and release the mouse button.  A dialog box
will ask if you really want to delete. Click <em>ok
</em></strong>. Run again to see how path has changed.  <p>

<LI> Set total frames to about 50, then one at a time, grab the center
key frame markers and slide them toward the right so that they are
spaced something like: <p>

<PRE>
1........2..3..4  
</PRE><p>

Run again, notice how movement speed was affected. <P>

<LI> Reverse the direction of travel by swapping the positions of the
two interior key frame markers.  <p>

</OL>

Parameters stored in the key frame path include viewing position and
looking direction.  The looking direction will be overridden though,
when the path is running, if <em>look here</em></strong> is active.
To see this effect with the above path loaded, select <em>look
here</em></strong> and click on a corner of the data, setting a new
fixed center of view.  Now run the path again.  Click on <em>look
cancel</em></strong> and run again. 
<A HREF="http://www2.gis.uiuc.edu:2280/modviz/viz/movies/flight.mpg">This</A>
is an example animation created in this way.  <p>

<h4> <strong> Image File Management </em></strong> </h4><p>

Because .rgb image files can end up taking a lot of disk space, users
should be mindful of disk storage capacity when attempting to create
an animation.  Keeping animation files and image dumps in directories
dedicated for such files helps in management.  A single rgb image
usually takes between 200K to 3M bytes of storage, depending upon size
and complexity.  If you use the SGI <em>movie</em></strong> program to
replay animations, each frame of the animation must have been saved to
files of identical dimensions; so especially if you are creating an
animation piecewise, at different sessions, it becomes important to
maintain a consistent size for the graphics window.  With the
<em>movie</em></strong> program and with other screen dump animating
programs, there is a zoom option to enlarge the animation images at
time of playback.  So if you want the animation to fill your screen,
you could set the width and height of the graphics window to half or a
third their playback sizes when writing the image files, then use the
zoom option (this will cause a loss of resolution though, since the
zoom just replicates pixels).  If you are making an animation to be
recorded onto video tape, it may be necessary to set the width and
height to specific dimensions.  <p>

New SGI programs released with IRIX 4.0.5,
<em>moviemaker</em></strong> and <em>movieplayer</em></strong>, are
also very useful for animations. <em>Moviemaker</em></strong> allows
you to create movie files from any number of rgb files at various
frame rates.  With <em>movieplayer</em></strong>, much longer
animations may be replayed than with <em>movie</em></strong> since the
frames are read directly from disk at run time rather than having to
be loaded into memory.  <p>
