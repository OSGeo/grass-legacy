<P>
<B>cell.out.tiff</B> - Plots maps with the Cell Driver and
exports them as a tiff-image.

<H2><B>Description</B></H2>

<P>
<B>cell.out.tiff</B> consists of a TCLTK-Module and a shell
script. With the TCLTK-Module you can choose various maps
(raster, vector and sites) and some parameters. The script
creates a set of display commands and plots the chosen
maps as a preview in the selected monitor. Then the script
initializes the cell driver and plots all the maps to
D_Cell and exports the D_Cell-map as a tiff-file. Finally
the script restores the previous settings.
<P>
It is the attempt to collect as many of the most common
display commands as possible in a single command and to
hide some awkward commands (e.g. changing projections for
the export) from the user.
<P>
The maps will be displayed in the following order:
<P>
Base raster map -&gt; additional raster maps -&gt; vector
polygons -&gt; vector maps -&gt; site maps -&gt; legend.
<P>
You can see all the commands as they are created from the
shell script, so if the result doesn't look like what
you've expected, you can see, what parameters might be
wrong. All messages from the display commands are displayed,
too. The user can use additional display commands,
if the pause option was set. The script waits until
the xterm window is closed, so you can use any display
command, you might need.

<H2><B>Entries</B></H2>

<P>
<B>Background</B> <B>color</B> - Sets the background color with d.erase.
The default is set to white, as the exported files are
probably used for printed maps. This is different to the
default behavior of d.erase.
<P>
<B>Raster</B> <B>maps</B><BR>

<B>Base</B> <B>raster</B> <B>map</B> - A raster map put in the background
with d.rast.
<P>
<B>Additional</B> <B>raster</B> <B>maps</B> - To display more than one
raster maps. The maps must be separated by comma
(this is automatically done, if the maps are chosen
with the raster-button) These raster maps can be
used as overlays by activating the overlay-button.
This option is similar to the overlay option of
d.rast.
<P>
<B>Vector</B> <B>maps</B><BR>

<B>Vector</B> <B>polygon</B> <B>maps</B> - displays vector polygon maps
with d.area. You can select border colors and fill
colors for each map with the next two entries. The
first map will be plotted with the first colors,
the second with the second and so on. All maps with
no color will be plotted with the default colors.
<P>
<B>Vector</B> <B>maps</B> - displays vector maps with d.vect. You
can choose the colors for the maps with the next
entry: Vector display colors.
<P>
<B>Site</B> <B>maps</B> - Display site markers with the d.sites command.
The parameters color, size and type can be selected with
the appropriate entries. As usual, the first entry of the
parameter belongs to the first site map and so on.
<P>
<B>Legend</B> - Displays a legend in the map with d.legend. You
can choose the size with the lines entry and the font
color with the color entry.
<P>
<B>Cell</B> <B>size</B> - The size of the resulting map in pixels. This
entry is required and cell.out.tiff will exit with an
error message, if this field is empty.
<P>
<B>Output</B> <B>tiff</B> <B>file</B> - The name and path of the resulting tiff
image.
<P>
<B>Pause</B> <B>for</B> <B>additional</B> <B>commands</B> - If this check-box is activated,
the scripts waits for additional display commands
after the preview has been created and before the D_Cell
map is exported.
<P>
<B>Preview</B> <B>only</B> - If this check-box is activated, no export
file is created and the script terminates after the preview.

<H2><B>Notes</B></H2>

<P>
Cell.out.tiff is a shell script, so it can easily be modified
to suit your needs.

<H2><B>Bugs</B></H2>

<P>
The script doesn't terminate proper, when the kill button
is used.
