<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>g.access</b></EM>  - Controls user access to the current GRASS mapset. 
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS</EM> File Management Program)</B> 

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>g.access</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program allows the user to control access to the
current mapset.  Normally, any user can read data from any
GRASS mapset. But sometimes it is desirable to prohibit
access to certain sensitive data. The <EM>g.access</EM>
command allows a user to restrict read and execute access
to the current mapset (see UNIX <EM>chmod</EM> command).
<EM>g.access</EM> will not modify write access to the
current mapset.

<P>

The user may, for example, allow only users in the same
UNIX group to read data files in the mapset, or restrict
the mapset to personal use only.

<P>
After typing 
<DL>
<DD>
<B>g.access</B> 
</DL>
the user will be presented with a screen page which reflects the current 
mapset permissions. The user can then change them. 
The screen page looks like:

| This program allows you to control access to your        | 
| mapset by other users.                                   |
|                                                          |
| Access may be granted/removed for everyone, or for       |
| everyone in your group.                                  |
|                                                          |
| Mark an 'x' to allow access;  erase the field to         |
| restrict access.                                         |

|                                                          |
|    AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE	   |
|                  (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)             	           |

</PRE>

If you remove the x (using the space bar), access will be denied to that 
class of user (group or other). 
If you type an x, access will be granted to that class of user. 

<H2>NOTES</H2>

There is no non-interactive version of <EM>g.access</B>.</EM> 

<P>
Under GRASS version 4.0, access to the mapset PERMANENT must be open 
to all users. 
This is because GRASS looks for the user's default geographic region definition 
settings and the location TITLE in files 
that are stored under the PERMANENT mapset directory. 
The <EM>g.access</EM> command, therefore, will not allow you to restrict 
access to the PERMANENT mapset. 

<P>
The 
<EM><A HREF="g.mapsets.html">g.mapsets</A></EM>
command isn't smart enough to tell 
if access to a specified mapset is restricted, and the user is therefore 
allowed to include the names of restricted mapsets in his search path. 
However, the data in a restricted mapset is still protected; any attempts 
to look for or use data in a restricted mapset will fail. 
The user will simply not see any data listed for a restricted mapset.
