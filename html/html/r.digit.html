<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>r.digit</b></EM> - Interactive tool used to draw and save
vector features on a graphics monitor using a pointing
device (mouse)

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>r.digit</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The GRASS tool <EM>r.digit</EM> provides the user with a
way to draw lines, areas, and circles on a monitor screen,
and to save these features in a cell file.  Lines, areas,
and circles are to be drawn using a pointing device
(mouse).  A mouse button menu indicates the consequences of
pressing each mouse button.  The user is requested to enter
the category number associated with the line, area, or
circle subsequently drawn by the user.  Lines, areas, and
circles are defined by the series of points marked by the
user inside the map window.  <EM>r.digit</EM> will close
areas when the user has not.  By drawing a series of such
features, the user can repair maps, identify areas of
interest, or simply draw graphics for advertisement.  When
drawing is completed, a raster map based on the user's
instructions is generated.  It is available for use as a
mask, in analyses, and for display.

<P>

Digitizing is done in a "polygon" method.  Each area is
circumscribed completely.  Two or more areas and/or lines
might define a single part of a map.  Each part of the map,
however, is assigned only the LAST area or line which
covered it.

<H3>THE PROCESS:</H3>

<OL>

<LI>Choose to define an area or line, quit, or finish.
If you quit, the session exits with nothing created.
If you choose to finish (<EM>done</EM>), you will be prompted for a
new map name;  the new map is then created.

<LI>If you choose to make an area or line you must identify
the category number for that area or line.

<LI>Using the mouse trace the line or circumscribe the area;
or, finish (go to Step 1).
