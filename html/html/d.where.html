<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>d.where</EM> is an <EM>interactive</EM> program that
allows the user, using the pointing device (mouse), to
identify the geographic coordinates associated with point
locations within the current geographic region in the
active display frame on the graphics monitor.

<P>

If the user runs <EM>d.where</EM> without specifying the
name of a spheroid on the command line, each mouse click
will output the UTM easting and northing of the point
currently located beneath the mouse pointer.  A
mouse-button menu is presented so the user knows which
mouse buttons to use. The output is always printed to the
terminal screen; if the output is redirected into a file,
it will be written to the file as well.

<H3>Flag:</H3> 

<DL>
<DT><B>-1</B>
<DD>Only one mouse click is executed. 
<BR>
This option is provided for shell scripts and programs which want to 
obtain only one point from the user. The output is only written 
to stdout, unless redirected into a file. The geographic location and 
mouse button pressed are output. 
</DL>

<H3>Parameter:</H3> 

<DL>
<DT><B>spheroid=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of a spheroid (for latitude/longitude coordinate conversion). 
<BR>
Options: australian, bessel, clark66, clark80, everest, international, 
wgs72, wgs84 
</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

This program uses the current geographic region setting and active frame. 
It is not necessary, although useful, to have displayed a map in the current 
frame before running <EM>d.where</EM>.
