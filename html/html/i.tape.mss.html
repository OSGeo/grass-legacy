<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>i.tape.mss</b></EM>  - An
<A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A> function that extracts
Multispectral Scanner (MSS) imagery data from half-inch
tape.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Image Processing Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>i.tape.mss</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>i.tape.mss</EM>
is a program that extracts Multispectral Scanner (MSS)
imagery data from tape.


<P>

This program must be run in a LOCATION_NAME with a x,y coordinate
system (i.e., a coordinate system with projection 0).
For further information regarding 
this LOCATION_NAME refer to the manual entry for 
<EM><A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A></EM>.

<P>

The first prompt in <EM>i.tape.mss</EM> asks the user for
the tape device name.  This is sometimes  /dev/rmt0 (for a
half-inch tape with a tape density of 1600), but this
varies with each machine.

<P>

The next prompt is:


<PRE>
Please mount and load tape, then hit RETURN --&gt;
</PRE>

<H2>IMAGE IDENTIFICATION MENU</H2>

The first menu in the program asks the user for information about the data.

<P>

<PRE>
    please enter the following information

 Tape Identification:                             __

 Image Description:                               __

 Title for the Extracted Raster (Cell) Files:     __

 AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
               (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

</PRE>

This program automatically enters the scene ID number and
the date of the image into the field for Tape
Identification.  The sun angles are automatically entered
into the field for Image Description.

<P>

The second menu is:

<PRE>
                MSS TAPE EXTRACTION
please select the desired tape window (geographic 
region definition) to extract

             first row: _______(1-2984)
             last row: _______(1-2984)

             first col: _______(1-3548)
             last col: _______(1-3548)


AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
              (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

</PRE>

The numbers in parentheses are the total number of rows and
columns on the tape including filler (zeros).  This
information and additional information can also be obtained
by running the GRASS program 
<EM><A HREF="i.tape.mss.h.html">i.tape.mss.h</A></EM> which
reads the header information on an MSS tape.  Any subset of
the image on tape may be extracted.  For a discussion of
row and column extraction see the subheading TITLEd 
<A HREF="#rowandcol.html">ROW AND
COLUMN EXTRACTION</A> below.


<P>

The next menu is:

<PRE>
please make an x by the bands you want extracted

                      _____ 1
                      _____ 2
                      _____ 3
                      _____ 4

AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
              (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)
</PRE>

MSS imagery has 4 bands, but the user may want to extract 
only a subset of these bands.  See the subheading in this entry
TITLEd 
<A HREF="#rowandcol.html">ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION</A>.

<P>

The user then is asked to enter the prefix/group for the
band files to be created.  This name will precede each band
file extracted into GRASS.  For example, if three bands are
extracted the following three (raster) band files will
result:


<P>
<EM>prefixname.1</EM>
<BR>
<EM>prefixname.2</EM>
<BR>
<EM>prefixname.3</EM>
<P>

Whatever <EM>prefixname</EM> is specified
will also automatically become the name for the 
<A HREF="i.group.html">imagery</A> group 
file being created.  Each image (i.e., each run of 
<EM><A HREF="i.tape.mss.html">i.tape.mss</A></EM>)
should be given a unique prefix/group name.

<P>

The extraction process will begin by first skipping the
number of specified files, advancing to the starting row,
and then reading the tape.  The percent completion of the
extraction is displayed on the screen. If more than one
tape is required to store the image, the program will pause
and inform the user to mount the next tape.

<P>

The extracted (raster) band files will be listed as raster
map layers available in the current MAPSET and may be
displayed using the GRASS commands

<EM><A HREF="d.display.html">d.display</A></EM>, 

<EM><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A></EM> or 

<EM><A HREF="i.points.html">i.points</A></EM>.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

After extracting an image from tape, the geographic region definition
in the x,y coordinate LOCATION_NAME will be set based upon the 
extracted rows and columns from the tape.  The relationship between
the image rows and columns and the geographic
coordinates of the region is discussed in 
the manual entry for <EM><A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A></EM>.


<P>

This program is interactive and requires no command line arguments.

<A NAME="rowandcol.html"><H2>ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION</H2></A>

The display options in GRASS allow the user to locate rows and
columns on the digital image.  If enough disk space is available, one
band of an entire image, or one band of a portion of an image known to 
contain the area of interest, can be extracted and displayed.  The 
<EM>measurements</EM>
option in <EM><A HREF="d.display.html">d.display</A></EM>, or 
<EM><A HREF="d.where.html">d.where</A></EM> (following the use of
<EM><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A></EM>) will echo 
x and y coordinates to the screen.  (These coordinates will display
negative numbers in the north-south direction, but ignoring the negative
sign will yield the row number.)  See the 
<EM><A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A></EM> manual entry
for further explanation.


<P>

If a photograph of the digital image is available, the rows and columns
to be extracted can be determined from it by associating inches with the 
total number of known rows and columns in the scene.  For example, if 
the total length of the photograph is 12 inches, the total number of rows
on the tape is 2000, and the northwest corner of the area of interest 
begins 2 inches from the top of the photo, then:
<PRE>
	12" / 2000 rows = 2" / x rows
	x = 333.333
</PRE>

The northwest corner of the area of interest starts at row
333.  The starting row, ending row, starting column, and
ending column can be calculated in this manner.
