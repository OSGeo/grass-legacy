<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>v.export</b></EM>  - Converts binary vector files into formatted ASCII files
for transfer to other computer systems.

<BR>

<EM>(SCS GRASS Vector Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>v.export</B>

<BR>

<B>v.export help</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program performs all of the processes that are needed to convert
binary vector files into formatted ASCII files.


<P>

It also creates support files:
<DL>
<DT> 

<DD>- an attribute flat file, which contains information for each area in the
DLG file -- i.e., the DLG area number, the GRASS area label, and the
GRASS category code (only created when exporting in DLG format);

<BR>


<DT> 

<DD>- an attribute file which contains the information from the <EM>dig_att</EM>
file (only created when exporting ASCII vector format).
</DL>

<P>

EXPORT FILES

<BR>

After entering the command <EM>v.export</EM>, the user will be asked
which type of file to export:

<DT> 

<DD>Exports from GRASS Vector (<EM><A HREF="v.digit.html">v.digit</A></EM>) Format


<P>


<DT> 

<DD>1  -	  ASCII DLG file from GRASS Vector Format

<BR>


<DT> 

<DD>2  -	  ASCII	DIGIT file from GRASS Vector Format

<BR>


<DT> 

<DD>3  -	  ASCII	SCS-GEF file from GRASS Vector Format

<BR>


<DT> 

<DD>4  -	  ASCII	ARC/INFO file from GRASS Vector Format

<BR>


<DT> 

<DD>5  -	  ASCII	DXF file from GRASS Vector Format

<BR>



<P>

If numbers 1-4 are chosen, <EM>v.export</EM> will respond with a request for the
vector file name.  After the user enters the file name the program
proceeds to create the respective output format files.


<P>

GRASS Vector to DLG File

<BR>

Converts binary vector files (such as those created by <EM>v.digit</EM>) to a DLG
file and creates the attribute file.  Both files are placed in the <EM>dlg</EM>
directory under a user selected name;  the attribute file has .att
appended.


<P>

GRASS Vector File into ASCII Vector File

<BR>

Converts a binary vector file into a readable ASCII file.  Both files
are placed int the <EM>dig_ascii</EM> directory under the same name as the given
vector file, the attribute file has .att appended.
<P>
GRASS Vector to SCS-GEF File
<BR>

Converts binary vector files to SCS-GEF files.  Creates the SCS-GEF
header, lines, text, and feature files.  All files are created and
placed in a $LOCATION/gef directory as a single UNIX file under a user
selected name.

<BR>

The following is the SCS-GEF file structure:

<PRE>
header record 1
   |      |  
header record n
-head
line record 1
   |      |    
line record n
-line
text record 1
   |      |    
text record n
-text
feature record 1
   |      |    
feature record n
-feat
</PRE>

The user will be required to use standard UNIX commands to separate
this file into individual files as required by SCS-GEF specifications.


<P>

GRASS Vector to ARC/INFO(generated) File

<BR>

Converts binary vector files to a "ARC ungenerate" format.  A GRASS
vector file to be exported to ARC/INFO must be either a line coverage
(must contain only lines) or a polygon coverage (must contain only area
edges).  Both "ungenerate lines and points" files are created and are
placed in a $LOCATION/arc directory under a user selected name.


<P>

The binary vector name will be used to name the various files that will
be created for export to ARC/INFO.  In the case of a labelled polygon
coverage, the following three files will be created:  a lines file with
the suffix .lin, a label-points file with the suffix .lab, and a
label-text file with the suffix .txt.


<P>

In the case of a line coverage the following two files will be created:
a lines file with the suffix .lin, and a label-text file with the
suffix .txt.


<P>

An unlabelled polygon or line coverage will result in a lines file
(.lin suffix) only.  See the DATA FILE FORMATS section of v.import for
more information on these files.


<P>

GRASS Vector to DXF file

<BR>

Converts binary vector files to a "DXF" format.
</DL>

<P>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Support files must be built using the GRASS program 
<EM><A HREF="v.support.html">v.support</A></EM> before exporting any vector file. 


<P>

Other ASCII formats are useful when importing/exporting data 
into and from GRASS.  Such data files should be in ASCII 
format when transferred.
