<H2>EXPLANATION</H2>

The "Site Occurrence Report" provides aggregate site
information organized by raster map layers.


<P>

The report header contains the following information:

<DL>
<DT><b>Location</b>
<DD>GRASS database location (e.g., yakima),
<DT><b>Mapset</b>
<DD>GRASS mapset (e.g., sample)
<DT><b>Analysis Region</b>
<DD>the rectangular area in which the
analysis was run, reflecting the
current geographic settings of the user's mapset.
<DT><b>Site List</b>
<DD>name and description of the site list used for the report
and the number of sites in the list.  See manual entry for
<EM><A HREF="s.menu.html">s.menu</A></EM> 
for more discussion about these site lists.
</DL>

The rest of the report is divided into reports for each
raster map layers specified by the user.  In this SAMPLE
OUTPUT, only one map layer (arch_survey) was specified.

<P>

Certain information heads up each of these reports:


<DL>
<DT><b>layer</b>

<DD>identifies the raster map layer along with the map layer TITLE.

<DT><b>cells in analysis region</b>

<DD>the size of the analysis region (in cells).

<DT><b>sites in analysis region</b>

<DD>the number of sites in the analysis region.

</DL>

For each map layer category which occurs in a cell falling
within the boundaries of the analysis region, as well as
totals for the map layer as a whole, various statistics are
presented:


<DL>
<DT><b>Site Characteristics</b>

<DD>These are the numbers (i.e., values)
and names (i.e., descriptions)
for each category (i.e., characteristic)
which occurs in the map layer.

<DT><b>cells cover</b>

<DD>the number of cells in the analysis region having the
category value (i.e., site characteristic).

<DT><b>% cover</b>

<DD>the predominance of the category within the analysis region.

<DT><b>expected sites</b>

<DD>the number of sites in the analysis region which would be
expected to be observed having the
category value if all sites were evenly
distributed by in the region.

<DT><b>actual sites</b>

<DD>the number of sites in the analysis region
which were occurred in cells having the category value.


<DT><b>chi square</b>

<DD>gives the user a statistical test of the hypothesis that
'site distribution is dependent on environmental factors'.
For this hypothesis to be true,
the chi-square test must fail since we are
calculating expected sites according to the hypothesis that
'sites are randomly distributed'.

<DT><b>degrees of freedom</b>

<DD>Number of degrees of freedom for the chi-square test.
Each category value will have 1 degree of freedom, and can be
tested alone.  The entire map layer will have 1 less degree of freedom
than the number of categories.

</DL>

<H2>NOTE</H2>

Category zero (0) throughout GRASS represents "no data".
Therefore, it is reported, but not included in the totals
or in the computation of the chi-square statistics.
