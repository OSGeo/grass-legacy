<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM>exit</EM>  - Exits the user from the current GRASS session. 

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>exit</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <EM>exit</EM> command ends the user's current GRASS
session and returns the user to the directory in which he
was working prior to entering GRASS.  When the user exits
GRASS, he is asked whether he wishes to save the files and
data stored under his current mapset, and (if maps are
present) whether the user wishes to selectively remove map
layers, before exiting the system.  By default, if the user
presses RETURN without responding to these questions, all
maps in the user's current mapset are saved.  However,
because such maps can consume much storage space on the
computer, the user should remove any unneeded files before
exiting.  (The user can also remove data before attempting
to <EM>exit</EM> GRASS using the 
<EM><A HREF="g.remove.html">g.remove</A></EM> command.)

<P>

Before typing <EM>exit</B>,</EM> the polite user should remember to release the 
graphics display monitor (using the command 
<B><A HREF="d.mon.html">d.mon</A> -r</B>) 
for use by other GRASS users. Otherwise, the display device may be locked 
for use by the user, even though the user has exited GRASS, until another 
user runs <EM><A HREF="d.mon.html">d.mon</A></EM> and unlocks 
this monitor for others' use. 

<P>

Each time the user re-enters GRASS, the variables described
in <EM><A HREF="g.gisenv.html">g.gisenv</A></EM> are
re-set. If the user wishes to change the mapset, location,
or data base on which he is working (i.e., those affected
by any GRASS programs running during the user's current
GRASS session), the user must <EM>exit</EM> GRASS and then
re-enter GRASS and specify a different mapset, location,
and/or data base location on the GRASS start-up page. When
the user re-enters GRASS, these variable settings (the
current mapset, location, and data base) are set by default
to those used in the user's previous GRASS session, unless
changed by the user.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

This program requires no command line arguments; the user
simply types <B>exit</B> on the command line to exit
GRASS.
