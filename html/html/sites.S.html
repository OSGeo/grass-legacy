<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>sites.S</b></EM>  - Description of the GRASS 
<EM><A HREF="s.menu.html">s.menu</A></EM> 
<A HREF="http://www.mathsoft.com">"S"</A> 
interface option.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This describes the GRASS 
<EM><A HREF="s.menu.html">s.menu</A></EM> 
<A HREF="http://www.mathsoft.com">"S"</A> 
statistical package
interface option.  See also the manual entry for 
<EM><A HREF="s.menu.html">s.menu</A></EM>.

<H2>SPECIAL ADJUSTMENT</H2>

Due to the fact that 
<A HREF="http://www.mathsoft.com">"S"</A> 
references all subscripts
beginning with 1, and the GIS data begins with 0, it was
necessary to add 1 to the category numbers.  Therefore,
category value 0 ("no data") becomes category value 1,
category 1 becomes category 2, etc.

<H2>S DATA STRUCTURES</H2>

Below are descriptions of the data structures created by
the interface.  As a general comment, within 
"S", 
simply
typing the data structure name will display the values
contained in the structure.  You may also find it
interesting to display the data structures using the 
"S"
function <EM>dput()</EM>.

<DT><B>cat.histo, (cat.#.histo)</B>

<DT>This structure contains the histogram for the
categories in each map layer.  The histogram contains the
number of cells of each category which occur in the user's
geographic region (see wind.n, et al., below).  It is a
2-dimensional integer array (matrix).  The first subscript
references the map layer.  The second subscript references
the category value.

<DL>
<DT>Examples:
<DD>cat.histo[2,5] is the cell count for layer 2, category 5.
<DD>cat.histo[2,]  is the full histogram for layer 2.
</DL>

Note:  since more than one layer may occur in the data, and the
number of categories in each layer varies, it was necessary to
create this structure with sufficient dimension to hold the
largest category value for all layers. 
Histogram data for categories which do not occur
are set to NA 
("S" 
notation for "no data").
However, there is also an individual histogram structure
for each layer:  cat.1.histo, cat.2.histo, etc.
These are simple vectors.


<DT><B>cat.name</B>

<DD>This structure contains the names for the categories in
each map layer.  It is a 2-dimensional character array
(matrix).  The first subscript references the map layer.
The second subscript references the category.


<DL>
<DT>Examples:
<DD>cat.name[2,5] is the name of category 5 for layer 2.
<DD>cat.name[2,]  are all category names for layer 2.
</DL>

Note:  since more than one layer may occur in the data, and the
number of categories in each layer varies, it was necessary to
create this structure with sufficient dimension to hold the
largest category value for all layers.
Names for categories which do not occur are set to ''.
However, there is also an
individual category name structure
for each layer:  cat.1.name, cat.2.name, etc.
These are simple vectors.

<DT><B>site.data</B>

<DD>This structure contains the data for each site.  It is
a 3-dimensional integer array.  The first subscript
references the categories which occurred at the site.  The
second subscript references the site.  The third subscript
references the layer.


<DL>
<DT>Examples:
<DD>site.data[,5,3] is the data for site 5 in layer 3.
<DD>site.data[,2,]  is the data for site 2 in all layers.
<DD>site.data[,,1]  is all site data for layer 1.
</DL>

Note: the size of the first dimension will be the number of
cells in a site, the size of the second dimension will be
the number of sites, the size of the third dimension will
be the number of layers.

<DT><B>site.mode</B>

<DD>Since 
"S" 
does not provide a statistical mode function, this structure
contains the most frequently occurring category for each site in each layer.
It is a 2-dimensional integer array (matrix).
The first subscript references the site.
The second subscript references the layer.


<DL>
<DT>Examples:
<DD>site.mode[5,3] is the mode for site 5 in layer 3.
<DD>site.mode[2,]  are the modes for site 2 in all layers.
<DD>site.mode[,1]  are all site modes for layer 1.
</DL>

Note:  this 'mode' is not the strict definition of the mode.
Since category 0 (which in 
"S" 
is category 1)
represents "no data" in the GIS databases,
it was excluded from the mode calculations
(essentially as if it had been NA).
For example, if the data for a site are
1 1 1 1 2 2 3 2 3 1 1, the mode will be 2.

<DT><B>layer.name</B>

<DD>This structure contains the raster map layer names.
It is a 2-dimensional array (i.e., a matrix).
The first subscript references the map layer.
The second subscript selects either the map layer name,
or the map layer TITLE.


<DL>
<DT>Examples:
<DD>layer.name[3,1] is the name of layer 3.
<DD>layer.name[3]   is also the name of layer 3.
<DD>layer.name[2]   is the name of layer 2.
<DD>layer.name[3,2] is the TITLE for layer 3.
</DL>

<DT><B>location</B>

<DD>This is a simple character vector giving the GRASS location
from which the data was extracted.

<DT><B>mapset</B>

<DD>This is a simple character vector giving the GRASS mapset.

<DT><B>nlayers</B>

<DD>This is a simple integer giving the number of map layers.

<DT><B>nsites</B>

<DD>This is a simple integer giving the number of sites.

<DT><B>site.e</B>

<DD>This is a simple integer vector giving the geographic
easting for each site.

<DT><B>site.n</B>

<DD>This is a simple integer vector giving the geographic
northing for each site.

<DT><B>site.name</B>

<DD>This is a simple character vector giving the
description for each site.

<DT><B>sitelist</B>

<DD>This is a simple character vector giving the name and
description of the site lists file from which the sites
were taken.

<DT><B>wind.n, wind.s, wind.w, wind.e</B>

<DD>These are simple real numbers giving the
north, south, west, east
of the mapset's current geographic region.

<DT><B>wind.res</B>

<DD>This is a simple real number giving the
GRASS database resolution (in meters).

</DL>

<H2>S MACROS</H2>

You may find the following 
"S" 
macros helpful when referencing
the 'site.data' and 'site.mode' structures,
since they allow you to specify parameters:

<PRE>
MACRO site.data(site, layer)
({
	site.data[ , site, layer]
})
END


MACRO site.mode(site, layer)
({
	site.mode[site, layer]
})
END
</PRE>

<H2>MACRO USAGE</H2>

To select the site.data for all sites for layer 2:

<DL>
<DD><B>?site.data(layer=2)</B>
</DL>


To select the site.data for site 4 in all layers:

<DL>
<DD><B>?site.data(site=4)</B>
</DL>

To select the site.mode for site 10 in layer 1:

<DL>
<DD><B>?site.mode(layer=1,site=10)</B>
</DL>

<H2>SORRY, BUT ...</H2>

These macros are not provided by the interface.  To use
these macros, you will have to type them into a text file
and then, from "S", issue the command:

<DL>
<DD><B>define("&lt;file&gt;")</B>
</DL>
