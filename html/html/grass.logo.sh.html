<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>grass.logo.sh</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>grass.logo.sh</EM>
is primarily a demonstration of the GRASS
<EM><A HREF="d.graph.html">d.graph</A></EM>
program in a UNIX Bourne shell macro
that generates the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers logo.
Users are encouraged to generate their own unique logos by writing similar
macro shell scripts.  Examine the contents of the input file
called <EM>grass.logo.sh</EM> 
located in the GRASS shell script command directory
(<KBD>$GISBASE/scripts</KBD>) to see how
the GRASS logo was generated using 
<EM><A HREF="d.graph.html">d.graph</A></EM> graphics commands.
The coordinates for this logo were taken from a drawing done on graph paper.

To view the graphics described by this file use
