<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.out.arc</EM>
is a GRASS data export program that converts files in GRASS vector format
to ARC/INFO's "Generate" file format.  The companion program <EM>
<A HREF="v.in.arc.html">v.in.arc</A>
</EM>
imports data in ARC/INFO's "Generate" format and
converts them to GRASS vector format.


<P>

This program can be run either non-interactively or interactively.
The program will be run non-interactively if the user specifies parameter values
on the command line using the following format:


<P>

<DL>
<DD>
<B>v.out.arc type=</B><EM>name </EM><B>vect=</B><EM>name </EM><B>arc_prefix=</B><EM>name</EM>
</DL>


<P>

Alternately, the user can simply type:


<P>

<DL>
<DD>
<B>v.out.arc</B>
</DL>


<P>

on the command line;  in this case, the program will prompt the user for
parameter values.

<DT><B>vect=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>The name of a GRASS vector file to be converted to ARC/INFO format.

<DT><B>arc_prefix=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>A prefix to be assigned to the ARC/INFO-format files output by <EM>v.out.arc</EM>.

<H2>INTERACTIVE MODE: USER PROMPTS</H2>

<EM>v.out.arc</EM> will prompt
the user to enter the name of a GRASS vector file to be exported to 
ARC/INFO and for a filename prefix to be used in naming the files
created by the program.
<P>
A GRASS vector file to be exported to ARC/INFO must either
contain only linear features (i.e., have only line coverage)
or contain only area edge features (i.e., have only polygon coverage).
<EM>v.out.arc</EM>
will begin by asking the user which type of coverage (line or polygon)
is to be imported:
<PRE>
     COVERAGE TYPE
     Enter "polygon" or "line"
     Hit RETURN to cancel request
     &gt;
</PRE> 
The program then prompts the user for the name of the GRASS vector file to be
converted to ARC/INFO format:
<PRE>
     VECTOR (DIGIT) FILENAME 
     Enter 'list' for a list of existing binary vector files
     Hit RETURN to cancel request
     &gt;
</PRE>

Next, the user is asked for a file-name prefix to be used in naming
the output ARC/INFO Generate format files:
<PRE>
     ARC/INFO (GENERATE) FILENAME PREFIX
     Hit RETURN to cancel request
     &gt;
</PRE>

The filename prefix will be used to name the various files
that will be created for export to ARC/INFO.
When labeled polygon coverage data are exported,
three such files will be created:  a <EM>lines file</EM> with the suffix .lin,
a <EM>label-points file</EM> with the suffix .lab, and a 
<EM>label-text file</EM> with the suffix .txt.
When line coverage data are exported, two such files will be created:
a <EM>lines file</EM> with the suffix .lin, and a <EM>label-text file</EM>
with the suffix .txt.
Export of unlabeled polygon or line coverage data will result in creation
of a <EM>lines file</EM> (.lin suffix) only.
See the DATA FILE FORMATS section for more information on these files.
<P>

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

Linear features and polygon data are made up of the series of arcs
(aka, vectors) outlining their perimeters.
The <EM>ARC/INFO Users' Guide</EM>, in its discussion of the <EM>Ungenerate</EM>
command, explains how line and polygon coverage data can be created from files
(like <EM>prefix.lin</EM> and <EM>prefix.pol</EM>)
containing the geographic coordinates of these arcs,
and from files (like <EM>prefix.lab</EM>)
containing the geographic coordinates of label-points.
Below is an example which illustrates
the creation, within ARC/INFO, of a polygon coverage data file
(named <EM>soils</EM>) from the files <EM>soils.pol</EM> and <EM>soils.lab</EM>.
<PRE>
   Arc: GENERATE SOILS 
   Generate: INPUT soils.pol
   Generate: LINES 
   Generating lines ...
   Generate: INPUT soils.lab
   Generate: POINTS
   Generating points ...
   Generate: QUIT
   Arc: _
</PRE>

The above example would create a polygon coverage data file named <EM>soils</EM>
with label-points. 
The label-points would have ID numbers that correspond to the GRASS
category values for the polygons in the coverage.  The INFO portion 
of ARC/INFO can be used to associate these label-point ID numbers 
with descriptive text from the <EM>soils.txt</EM> file.

LINES FILE, also know as <EM>prefix.lin</EM> or <EM>prefix.pol</EM> file:

<BR>

This text file is a "Generate" format lines file.  The <EM>lines</EM> option of the 
ARC/INFO <EM>Generate</EM> command can be used to read this file into ARC/INFO.  
Each line in the file has a unique line-ID number.

LABEL-POINTS FILE, also known as <EM>prefix.lab</EM> file:

<BR>

This text file will be created by
<EM>v.out.arc</EM>
if the vector file being exported represents a polygon coverage.
<EM>prefix.lab</EM> consists of a list of label-point (x,y) coordinates,
each with a unique label-point ID number.

2 243458.37 199282.28
3 243458.37 195199.28
</PRE>

LABEL-TEXT FILE, also known as <EM>prefix.txt</EM> file:

<BR>

In the case of polygon coverage data, this file associates an integer
category value
and a category label ("attribute") text string (containing no spaces)
with each label-point ID number.
In the case of line coverage data, this file associates an integer category value
and an attribute text string with each line-ID number.


<P>

The first column is the row number (which is arbitrary), the second column 
contains the category value, the third column holds the line or label-point ID
number, and the fourth column contains the attribute text string.
