<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>r.mask</b></EM>  - Establishes or removes the current working mask. 
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Raster Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>r.mask</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <EM>r.mask</EM> program allows the user to block out
certain areas of a map from analysis, by "hiding" them from
sight of other GRASS programs.  This is done by
establishing a mask.  While a mask exists, most GRASS
programs will operate only on data falling inside the
masked area, and ignore any data falling outside of the
mask.

<P>

Because the mask is actually only a reclass file called
"MASK" that is created when the user identifies a mask
using <EM>r.mask</EM>, it can be copied, renamed, removed,
and used in analyses, just like other GRASS raster map
layers.  The user should be aware that a mask remains in
place until a user renames it to something other than
"MASK", or removes it using <EM>r.mask</EM> or

<EM><A HREF="g.remove.html">g.remove</A></EM>. 

<P>

<EM>r.mask</EM> provides the following options: 
<PRE>
	 1 Remove the current mask 
	 2 Identify a new mask 
	RETURN Exit from program 
</PRE>

The user establishes a new mask by choosing option (2).
The user will be asked to name an existing raster map layer
from among those available in the current mapset search
path.  Once done, the user is shown a listing of this map's
categories, and is asked to assign a value of "1" or "0" to
each map category.  Areas assigned category value "1" will
become part of the mask's surface, while areas assigned
category value "0" will become "no data" areas in the MASK
file.

<P>

If a category is not assigned category value "1" it will
automatically be assigned the category value "0" in the
resulting MASK file.  Any cells falling in category "0"
will fall outside the newly formed mask, and their presence
will be ignored by GRASS programs run later on, as long as
the MASK file remains in place.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The above method for specifying a "mask" may seem
counterintuitive.  Areas inside the mask are not hidden;
areas outside the mask will be ignored until the MASK file
is removed.

<P>

This program actually creates a raster map layer (reclass
type) called <EM>MASK</EM>, which can be manipulated
(renamed, removed, copied, etc.) like any other raster map
layer.

<P>

Somewhat similar program functions to those performed by
<EM>r.mask</EM> can be done using

<EM><A HREF="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</A></EM>, 

<EM><A HREF="g.region.html">g.region</A></EM>,

and other programs. 

<P>

This program can only be run interactively. 

<P>

Note that some programs, like 

<EM><A HREF="r.stats.html">r.stats</A></EM>, 

have options that allow the 
user to see the effects of the current mask without removing the current 
mask. See, for example, use of the <B>-m</B> option for 

<EM><A HREF="r.stats.html">r.stats</A></EM>.
