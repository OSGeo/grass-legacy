<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>v.in.scsgef</b></EM>  - Converts SCS Geographic Exchange Format (SCS-GEF)
ASCII data into a GRASS vector file.

<EM>(SCS GRASS Vector Program)</EM>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.in.scsgef</EM> allows a user to create a GRASS vector
file from a SCS-GEF format ASCII file.
<P>
<DT> 

<DD>1.  The program will first request the name of the SCS-GEF file to be
read in, it expects to find the data in the current directory. It is
suggested to create a <EM>gef</EM> directory and put all SCS-GEF data there.
<P>
<DD>2.  The program will then request the name of a GRASS vector file.
<P>
<DD>3.  The program will then request the name of a SUBJECT file.  A subject
file will be used to assign GRASS category codes to the SCS-GEF data.
It is structured the same as a <EM>dig_cats</EM> category file.  It is suggested
that a SUBJ directory be created in the GRASS location and a file
containing all SCS-GEF text labels by category be created.  This will be
required to provide consistancy across several maps (quads) within one
location.  The user may use the <EM>vi</EM> text editor or the SCS macro
<EM>make_subject</EM> to create it.
<P>
<DD>4.  The program will then read the SCSGEF header information,
interactively present information that was available, and request
additional data of the user.  These questions are :
<P>
Name of their organization. (from SCS-GEF)

<BR>

Digitized Date.             (from SCS-GEF)

<BR>

Map Name.                   (from SCS-GEF)

<BR>

Map Location.               (from SCS-GEF)

<BR>

Other Information.          (from SCS-GEF)

<BR>

State FIPS code.

<BR>

County FIPS code.

<BR>

Present GEF Coord. System (table, stplane, ll, utm).

<BR>

Coordinate System Desired (utm, stplane, ll, albers).

<BR>



<P>

The program will then actively read the SCS-GEF data file and process
it,


<P>

scripts contains SCS macro <EM>make_1_gef</EM>.  This macro makes one file out of
the three (3) files found in SCS-GEF (see SCS-GEF technical
specifications for more information).  The macro must be run on each
data set BEFORE <EM>v.in.scs.gef</EM>.
