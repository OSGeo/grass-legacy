<h2>NAME</h2>

<EM><b>d.profile</b></EM>  - Displays profiles of a user-specified raster map layer. 
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Display Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>d.profile</B> 

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This command works only interactively. It clears the entire
graphics screen and provides a graphical interaction
allowing the selection of transects for which profiles are
then generated.

<H2>USER PROMPTS</H2>

First, you will be presented with a prompt asking you to
choose a raster map layer to be profiled. Once you specify
a valid raster map layer name, the map layer will be
displayed in the left half of the graphics display, and the
right half of the dispay will be divided into four display
frames. There will also be two frames along the top of the
display: a mouse-button menu frame on the left, and a
status frame on the right.

<P>

The mouse-button menu initially offers you three options: 

<DL>
<DD>
Mouse Buttons: <BR>
Left: Where am I? <BR>
Middle: Mark FIRST Point of Profile Line. <BR>
Right: QUIT this. <BR>
</DL>

You may query the displayed raster map layer by indicating
points with the left mouse-button. The coordinates and
category value of each point that you indicate will be
displayed on in the status frame.  If you mark the first
point of the profile line you will be presented with the
following mouse-button menu:

<DL>
<DD>
Mouse Buttons: <BR>
Left: Where am I? <BR>
Middle: Mark SECOND Point of Profile Line. <BR>
Right: QUIT this. <BR>
</DL>

Once you mark the second point of the profile line, the
profile line will be labeled (with a letter from A to D)
and displayed in one of the four display frames on the
right hand side of the screen. You will then be presented
with a third mouse-button menu:

<DL>
<DD>
Mouse Buttons: <BR>
Left: DO ANOTHER <BR>
Middle: CLEAR DISPLAY <BR>
Right: QUIT this. <BR>
</DL>

If you would like to view another profile, click on the
left mouse-button.  If you would like to redisplay the
raster map layer and clear out the four profile frames,
click on the middle mouse-button. If you would like to
quit, then click on the right button.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Useful enhancements to <EM>d.profile</EM> would include: 

<OL>

<LI>Adding an option to display profiles using category
colors, like a bar-chart.

<LI>Allowing profile lines to be defined by a series of
points, not just two.

<LI>Allowing profiles to be saved in a file, for later
viewing.

<LI>Allowing the user to enter profile line points by
typing coordinates.

</OL>

<H2>BUGS</H2>

<P>
<EM>d.profile</EM> reads every raster map as if it were a CELL type.
Therefore, if the range for floating point rasters is very small, 
it will not be profiled very well (possibly not at all).
