<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>paint</b></EM>  - Description of hardcopy color output system for GRASS.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

The <B>paint</B> system allows the user to produce color hardcopy
maps of vector, raster, and sites file data at any scale.
For a discussion of the GRASS <B>paint</B> functions, see the
manual entries for

and <EM><A HREF="p.select.html">p.select</A></EM>.

<H2>PAINT DEVICES</H2>

The GRASS paint system supports multiple color printers
using a <EM>device</EM> driver concept.  The paint (p.)
functions listed above send graphics requests to
device-dependent paint drivers.  These drivers translate
the application requests into device-dependent requests to
produce hardcopy maps.

<H2>INSTALLING A PAINT DRIVER</H2>

A number of paint drivers have been distributed with
GRASS.  The installation of a driver is a 2 step process.
The first involves identifying the driver(s) which
correspond to printer(s) connected to your system and
compiling those drivers.  The second involves telling each
driver which i/o port it is to use.


<OL>

<LI>The source code for the drivers lives in
<KBD>$GISBASE/../src/paint/Drivers</KBD> (The variable
GISBASE refers to the directory in which GRASS is installed
on your system.)

<BR>

The selection and compilation of the drivers is done when GRASS
is compiled as a whole.

<LI>The port configuration is handled using the UNIX
<EM>ln</EM> command.

</OL>

Each driver expects to send its output to <KBD>/dev/</KBD><EM>driver</EM>.
For example, the <B>tek4695</B> driver expects to find a
tektronix 4695 (or 4696) printer on <KBD>/dev/tek4695</KBD>.


<P>

Suppose the printer is actually on <KBD>/dev/tty10</KBD>.
Then, a link named <KBD>/dev/tek4695</KBD> is made to <KBD>/dev/tty10</KBD>:


<DL>
<DD><KBD>ln /dev/tty10 /dev/tek4695</KBD>
</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

There are 2 drivers which do not use i/o ports.  One is the
<B>preview</B> driver, which sends its output to the
graphics screen instead of a hardcopy printer.  This driver
is very handy and should definitely be compiled on your
system.


<P>

The other is the <B>null</B> driver, which is used for
debugging purposes and probably should not be compiled on
your system.


<P>

If you compile either of these drivers, you shouldn't create
a <KBD>/dev</KBD> file for them.
