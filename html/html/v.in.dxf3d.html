<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The v.in.dxf3d data conversion program generates GRASS dig_att files from a
DXF file with Z values.


<P>

This program, in conjunction with v.in.dxf, is ideal for automaticaly importing,
to GRASS vector file, layers with Z values (isolines and level contours) from 
DXF format files.


<P>

Firts should be run the v.in.dxf program for import the DXF polylines to binary
GRASS vector file format (dig). Later, the DXF Z values of the isolines layers 
with v.in.dxf3d (dig_att) must be imported, and finally run v.support to 
attach at this layers their elevations.
The v.in.dxf3d.sh script can be used to make all this automaticaly, for a maximun
of two isolines layers (normally contours and master contours) from one DXF file.


<P>

The v.in.dxf program only recognizes, by now, the Z values  from polylines 
entities in the DXF format.

<H2>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</H2>



<P>

Parameters

<DT><EM>dxf</EM> 

<DD>Name of the DXF input design file from where will be extracted the Z values.

<DT><EM>lines</EM> 

<DD>Name(s) of layer(s) in DXF input file containing isoline data with Z values,
and the name(s) to be assigned to the GRASS vector data (dig_att) files
output.


<P>


<H2>BUGS</H2>

The program only recognizes the Z values if they are in the "30" field of the
POLYLINE entity section.


<P>

If the input DXF file is in MS-DOS text format, with CR/LF instead of Unix LF, 
the program doesn't run. To avoid this problem, import to Unix your DXF-MSDOS 
format files with FTP in ascii mode or with a command able to convert this files 
(DOS-COPY, mcopy, etc).
