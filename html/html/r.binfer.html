<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r.binfer</EM> is an expert system shell containing an
inference engine based on Bayesian statistics (reasoning
from past experience).  It is designed to assist human
experts in a field develop computerized expert systems for
land use planning and management. These expert systems are
designed to aid non-experts make decisions about land use.

<P>

In Bayesian expert system programs like
<EM>r.binfer</EM>, the system bases the probable
impacts of a future land use action on the conditional
probabilities about the impact of similar past actions.

</DL>

<P>

Using appropriate <EM>r.binfer</EM> syntax, the human
expert structures an input knowledge/control script with an
appropriate combination of map layer category values (GRASS
raster map layers that contain data on soil texture, slope,
density, etc.) and attributes relevant to decision-making
(e.g., rainfall, temperature, season, subjective judgement,
etc.).  Options exist for specifying a user interface and a
data base containing prior and conditional probabilities
necessary to infer the value of a goal attribute.  The
expert also specifies the format for display of end results
(raster map layers) in the input script.  New raster map
layers -- one for each possible inferred attribute value --
are created that contain the probability of the inferred
attribute value occurring in each grid cell.

<P>

Alternately, a single new map layer called
<EM>r.binfer</EM> (or whatever <EM>output</EM> name is
specified by the user) is also output.  This map shows, for
each grid cell, the inferred attribute value that has the
highest probability of occurring in each grid cell, given
the values of the <EM>input</EM> raster map layer and
contextual attributes.

<P>

<EM>r.binfer</EM> scripts are typed into a file by the user
using a system editor like <EM>vi</EM>, and then input to
<EM>r.binfer</EM> as the <EM>input</EM> file named on the
command line.  For a complete description of the
<EM>input</EM> syntax, see the document 
</B>GRASS Tutorial: r.binfer</B> (forthcoming).  
For example <EM>r.binfer</EM>
scripts see the <A HREF="#EXAMPLES.html">EXAMPLES</A> section
below.  The results are used to generate the new raster map
layers in the user's current mapset.

<P>

As stated above, <EM>r.binfer</EM> scripts contain
descriptions of two types of input attributes. The map
layer type attributes are actual GRASS raster map layers,
with the values defined to be ranges of the categories
within that raster map layer.  For example, if the user
chooses slope as one of the layer attributes, the possible
values for the slope attribute might be the following:

<PRE>
flat         (slopes between 0 and 5 degrees) 
low          (slopes between 6 and 10 degrees) 
medium       (slopes between 11 and 30 degrees) 
steep        (slopes greater than 31 degrees) 
</PRE>

The contextual attributes are those that do not represent
raster map layers, but rather, information that reflects
criteria relevant to the specific decision being
contemplated.  For example, if the user chooses "rainfall
amount" as one of the contextual attributes, possible
values assigned to the "rainfall amount" attribute might be
the following:


<PRE>
low          (rainfall amounts less than an inch) 
medium       (rainfall amounts between one and three inches) 
high         (rainfall amounts grater than three inches) 
</PRE>

The inferred attribute values are specified along with a
prior probability and a table of conditional probabilities
that indicate the probability of that inferred attribute
value occurring given that an input attribute value has
occurred.

<P>

<EM>r.binfer</EM> will determine the value of contextual
attributes by prompting the user for input. It will then
open each of the raster map layers corresponding to each
map layer attribute. <EM>r.binfer</EM> then determines the
values for all map layer attributes in each grid cell.
Using the conditional probability tables, the prior
probabilities, and Bayes' theorem, <EM>r.binfer</EM>
calculates the output probabilities for each inferred value
and writes its probability of occurrence as a percentage.
It also determines which value is most likely to occur in
that cell and writes that to the <EM>output</EM> file
name.


<H2><A NAME="EXAMPLES.html">EXAMPLES</A></H2>

The two sample scripts shown below illustrate only the use of <EM>r.binfer</EM> to: 
<OL>
<LI>estimate the probability that an avalanche will occur, and 
<LI>infer the probability of finding pine mountain beetles, 
</OL>
at each cell across a landscape, given the input map layer
attributes shown below.  The author makes no claims as to
the correctness of using these criteria to infer either
event.
<P>

Some Notes on Script Construction. 

<OL>
<LI> No Data ( or what to do with category zero). 

<P>

If category zero is excluded from the ranges of any layer 
attribute value, it is treated as "no data" and the 
resulting probability and combined maps will reflect this. 

<P>

Otherwise, category zero is treated just like any other cell value. 

<LI> Category ranges for layer attributes. 

<P>

The category ranges are specified using 
<EM><A HREF="r.reclass.html">r.reclass</A></EM> rules. 
For example, a value list for slope might look like this: 

<PRE>
(flat [0 1 thru 3], gentle [4 thru 8], 
moderate [9 thru 15], other [16 thru 89]). 
</PRE>

<LI> Question Attachments. 

<P>

Question attachments can be supplied for and context attribute or 
attribute value. If names are chosen cleverly, the default menu 
should be sufficient. 

<LI> Determinant List. 

At this time the determinant list serves no real purpose. 
Planned extensions to binfer will make use of this list, 
so just don't use it for now. 

<LI> Probabilities. 

The conditional probability table is very important, try to 
be sure of its accuracy.
