<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Reads a GRASS raster map as input.  Calculates textural
features based on spatial dependence matrices for
north-south, east-west, northwest, and southwest directions
using a 3x3 neighborhood (i.e., a distance of 1).  Writes
to standard output.  Be sure to carefully set your
resolution (using

<EM><A HREF="g.region.html">g.region</A></EM>) 

before running this program, or else your computer could
run out of memory.  Also, make sure that your raster map
has no more than 255 categories.

Darrell McCauley).

<H2>BUGS</H2>

The program can run incredibly slow for large raster files 
(larger than 64 x 64) and command line options are limited.

<P>

The method for finding (14) the maximal correlation coefficient, which
requires finding the second largest eigenvalue of a matrix Q, does not
always converge. 

<P>

It would be interesting to write raster files to map features for 
neighborhoods, with some sort of quantization to record category values.
This may be useful for image classification schemes, but this exercise is 
left to the reader (the changes would be fairly trivial).
