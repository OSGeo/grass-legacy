<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>v.what</b></EM>  - Query the category contents of a (binary) vector map layer 
at user-selected locations.
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Vector Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>v.what</B>
<BR>
<B>v.what help</B>
<BR>
<B>v.what </B>[<B>-1i</B>] <B>map=</B><EM>name</EM>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.what</EM> outputs the category value(s) associated
with user-specified location(s) in a vector map layer.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

If the <B>-i</B> flag is specified, the program activates
the mouse, and expects the user to indicate the location(s)
to be queried by depressing a mouse button over desired
location(s) within the current geographic region in the
active display frame on the graphic monitor.

<P>

If the <B>-i</B> flag is not used, the program expects
eastings and northings to be entered from standard input.
In this case, input is terminated by typing Control-D.

<H3>Flags:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>-1</B> 
<DD>Identify and query just one point location.  

<DT><B>-i</B> 
<DD>Query interactively using mouse. 
</DL>

<H3>Parameter:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>map=</B><EM>name</EM> 
<DD>Name of an existing binary vector map in the user's mapset search path.
</DL>

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

Two sample <EM>v.what</EM> sessions are given below.  

<P>

Although it is not necessary that the user first display a
vector map to be queried in the active display frame, it is
helpful to have a map displayed there for reference for
interactive queries.

<DL>
<DT><B>v.what -i map=</B><EM>roads.24000</EM>
</DL>

After typing this, the user moves the mouse to a desired location
on the displayed <EM>roads</EM> map layer,
and presses the left mouse button to query the category value of the
<EM>roads</EM> vector map at this location.  The program then
outputs the category value of a line type corresponding to this
user-selected map location, for the vector map queried by the user.


<P>

The query may be repeated as often as desired using the left mouse button.
The right button on the mouse is used to quit the <EM>v.what</EM> session.


<P>

Users can also use this program inside of shell scripts. For example,
if the file <EM>coords</EM> contains three UTM coordinates:

<PRE>
599817.37 4922332.96
593512.25 4917170.38
604979.96 4921655.90
</PRE>

<DL>
<DT><B>cat coords | v.what map=</B><EM>landcover</EM>
</DL>

will return information about these three locations and
then exit.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<EM>v.what</EM> output can be redirected into a file.

<P>

<EM><A HREF="d.what.rast.html">d.what.rast</A></EM> 
can be used to interactively query the map category
contents of multiple raster map layers at user-selected
locations.

<P>

<EM>v.what</EM> was created from 
<EM><A HREF="d.what.vect.html">d.what.vect</A></EM> 
so that non-interactively
queries could be made. Specifying the <B>-i</B> flag makes <EM>v.what</EM> 
behave just as <EM>d.what.vect</EM> does.
