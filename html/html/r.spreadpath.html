<H2>NAME</H2>
<B>r.spreadpath</B> - Recursively traces the least cost path backwards to cells
from which the cumulative cost was determined. (GRASS Raster Program)

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
<B>r.spreadpath</B>

<BR><B>r.spreadpath [-v] x_input=</B><EM>name</EM> <B>y_output=</B><EM>name</EM> [<B>coordinate=</B><EM>x,y[x,y,...]</EM>]<B>output=</B><EM>name</EM>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<EM>r.spreadpath</EM> recursively traces the least cost path backwards to the origin,
given backlink information input map layers and target locations from where paths are to be traced. The backlink information map layers record each cell's backlink UTM northing (the y_input) and easting (the x_input) coordinates from which the cell's cumulative cost was determined.

<P>

The backlink inputs can be generated from another GRASS raster program <EM>r.spread</EM>. One of the major applications of <EM>r.spreadpath</EM> along with <EM>r.spread</EM> is to accurately find the least cost corridors and/or paths on a raster setting. More information on <EM>r.spread</EM> and <EM>r.spreadpath</EM> can be found in Xu (1994).

<H2>Flags:</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>-v</B>
<DD>Run verbosely.
</DL>

<H2>Parameters:</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>x_input=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of input raster map layer containing backlink UTM easting coordinates.

<DT><B>y_input=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of input raster map layer containing backlink UTM northing coordinates.

<DT><B>coordinate=</B><EM>x,y[,x,y,x,y, ...]</EM>
<DD>Each x,y coordinate pair gives the easting and northing (respectively) geographic coordinates of a target point from which to backwards trace the least cost path. As many
points as desired can be entered by the user.

<DT><B>output=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of raster map layer to contain output. Also can be used as the map layer of the input target points. If so used, the input target point map will be overwritten by the output.
</DL>

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
The user can run <EM>r.spreadpath</EM> either interactively or non- interactively. The program is run interactively if the user types <EM>r.spreadpath</EM> without specifying flag setting and parameter values on the command line. In this case, the user will be prompted for input.

<P>

Alternately, the user can run <EM>r.spreadpath</EM> non-interactively, by specifying the names of raster map layers and desired options on the command line, using the form:

<P>
<DD><B>r.spreadpath [-v] x_input=</B><EM>name</EM> <B>y_output=</B><EM>name [coordinate=x,y[x,y,...]]</EM><B>output=</B><EM>name</EM>
