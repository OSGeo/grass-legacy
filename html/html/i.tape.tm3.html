<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> is a successor to <EM>i.tape.tm</EM>.  <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> can import Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery in fast format, full scene, and quadrant scene formats.  Imports may be done from 1600 BPI and 6250 BPI 9-track tapes, QIC 150 tape, 8mm tape, or from disk files.  <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> is completely command-line driven, although the usual GRASS parser may be used if command line options are not given.  During the import, the program may also prompt for filenames to use and tapes to be mounted.
<P>

<EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> must be run in a location with an x,y coordinate system (i.e., a coordinate system with a projection 0.)  Refer to the imagery manual entry.

<H3>Flags:</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>-e</B>
<DD>Examine tape or files.  A summary of information from the scene's headers is printed.  No bands are imported.  If this option is given, all other options except input and blocksize are ignored.

<DT><B>-p</B>
<DD>Display the percentage of work done.  By default, <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> displays the number of lines for each band that it has imported so far.

<DT><B>-q</B>
<DD>Run quietly.  Error messages are still printed but messages about the import's progress are not.
</DL>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>input=name</B>
<DD>The name of the device or file to extract imagery from.  If not given, <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> will assume the import is from disk files and will prompt for file¡ names.

<DT><B>group=name</B>
<DD>The name of the group to store imported bands in.  The group will be created if it does not already exist.

<DT><B>output=prefix</B>
<DD>The prefix with which to name the raster maps for each band imported.  The band number of each raster map is appended to this prefix.  If omitted, the group name is used as the prefix.

<DT><B>bands=band[,band,...]</B>
<DD>The list of bands to import.  Band numbers range from 1 to 7 inclusive.  Band numbers may be specified in any order.  For fast format imagery, a band number of "P" may be used to specify the panchromatic band.

<DT><B>blocksize=blocksize</B>
<DD>The blocksize to use for reading tapes.  For QIC-150 tapes, this value must be a multiple of 512.  The default is 32768.

<DT><B>rows=firstrow,lastrow</B>
<DD>The range of rows within each band to import.  Must have firstrow <= lastrow.  Row numbers increase from top to bottom.  The topmost, or northernmost, row of each band is row 1.

<DT><B>cols=firstcol,lastcol</B>
<DD>The range of columns within each band to import.  Must have firstcol <= lastcol.  Column numbers increase from left to right.  The leftmost, or westernmost, column of each band is column 1.

<DT><B>title=title</B>
<DD>The title to give each extracted band.  The default is "Landsat TM Imagery"
</DL>

<H3>USAGE</H3>
<EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> can import Landsat TM imagery in three formats: full scene, quadrant scene, and fast format.  Full scene and quadrant scene file formats are very similar, and differ only in the size of the image.  A quadrant scene corresponds to one quarter of a full scene of the same area.  <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> can read fast format imagery in its A and B versions.  See the references for file format documents.
<P>

Information about a TM scene can be obtained by using the <EM>-e</EM> option.  It is useful to use this option before importing imagery.  This option will examine the files on tape or disk and print important information about the scene.  Fields printed include the file format, size of image in pixels, scene ID, and date of creation.  Coordinates for the scene center or corners are given depending on the file format.  For full scene and quarter scene formats, the <EM>-e</EM> option requires the volume directory file and a leader and imagery file from a single band.  For the fast format, the <EM>-e</EM> option requires only a header file.
<P>

<EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> allows the block size to be specified.  This is the number of bytes to read from a tape at a time.  The block size is optional; specifying it may or may not make the import run faster.  The default is 32768.  Look on the tape's label to find the block size.  For QIC-150 tapes, the block size must be a multiple of 512 or the import will fail.  The maximum allowable block size is one megabyte (1024 * 1024 = 1048576 bytes.)  The block size is not used when importing from disk files.
<P>

The following sections describe the tape file formats and how to import from disk files.  If you are copying imagery between tapes or to disk, it is necessary to understand how the files are arranged on tape so that <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> will be able to import from copied tapes correctly.  If you are importing from the original tapes or exact copies there is no need to be concerned with the tape formats.

<H3>FULL SCENE AND QUADRANT SCENE FILE FORMATS</H3>
For full scene and quadrant scene formats, it may require more than one tape to store the seven bands of a single Landsat scene.  The set of tapes containing imagery for a single scene is called a volume set.  Each tape in a set has the same format.  The first file on the tape is a volume directory file.  This is followed by a leader file, imagery file, and trailer file for each band on the tape.  There may be supplemental files after the the bands, but these are not used by <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM>.  For example, a tape containing bands 1-3 of Landsat imagery contains these files:
<PRE>
       Volume Directory File
       Band 1 Leader File
       Band 1 Imagery File
       Band 1 Trailer File
       Band 2 Leader File
       Band 2 Imagery File
       Band 2 Trailer File
       Band 3 Leader File
       Band 3 Imagery File
       Band 3 Trailer File
       Supplemental File
</PRE>

When importing from tape, the program will prompt the user to mount each tape needed.  Tapes may be mounted in any order.  Only the tapes that contain the bands to be imported need be mounted.  Be sure that tapes are rewound or positioned correctly before mounting them.

<H3>IMPORT FROM DISK FILES</H3>
<EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> can import imagery from disk files.  The volume directory must be copied from tape to disk, as well as the leader, imagery, and trailer files for each band to import.  To speed the import, the filenames should all have the same prefix and have a .ls# suffix, where # is an integer that increases sequentially from zero.  The prefix may be any name.  For example, if you wanted to import bands 2 and 3 of a quadrant scene from disk files, you would copy the files from tape and give them names like this:
<PRE>
       Volume Directory File       landsat.ls0
       Band 2 Leader File          landsat.ls1
       Band 2 Imagery File         landsat.ls2
       Band 2 Trailer File         landsat.ls3
       Band 3 Leader File          landsat.ls4
       Band 3 Imagery File         landsat.ls5
       Band 3 Trailer File         landsat.ls6
</PRE>
The volume directory file must have the .ls0 suffix.  Only the leader, imagery, and trailer files for the bands to be imported need be copied to disk.  The prefix "landsat" is used here, but any name can be used.  Each file must have a .ls# suffix, though.  By naming the files this way, <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> can easily read the files in the correct order.  Once these files are on disk, they may be imported with a command like this:
<P>

<DD><EM>i.tape.tm3 input=landsat group=landsat bands=1,2,3</EM>
<P>

The input option specifies the prefix to use for the file¡ names.  The .ls# suffix should not be included in the input option.  <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> will automatically append the .ls# suffix to each file in turn.
<P>

Naming the imagery files in this fashion is the easiest way to import from disk.  However, <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> can import from files that have any names.  The program will prompt for filenames.  Enter the filenames at each prompt in the order that the files would be read from tape in.  To import this way, omit the input option in the command, like this:
<P>

<DD><EM>i.tape.tm3 group=landsat bands=1,2,3</EM>
<P>

If you are importing from disk files with .ls# filenames, <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> will prompt for a filename at any time that it cannot find the next file to read.

<H3>FAST FORMAT TM IMAGERY</H3>
Like full scenes and quadrant scenes, imagery in fast format may come on multiple tapes, depending on the amount of data.  The file format is very simple, consisting of a header file followed by imagery files for each of the bands.  The imagery files are flat data files; they have no header information within them.  For example, a set of seven bands for a scene in fast format may come on three 9-track tapes and look like this:
<PRE>
       Tape 1         Tape 2Tape 3
       Header File    Header FileHeader File
       Band 1         Band 4Band 7
       Band 2         Band 5
       Band 3         Band 6
</PRE>

Because the band files have no header information in them, the only way <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> can tell which band is which is by the order the files come in their header file.  If fast format imagery is ever copied to other tapes be sure the files are kept in the same order as they came.
<P>

To import fast format imagery from disk files, copy the files to disk using the same naming convention used for quadrant and full scenes.  The header file must have a .ls0 extension.  The band 1 imagery file should have a .ls1 extension, band 2 a .ls2 extension, etc.  If a panchromatic band is available, give it a .ls8 extension, for lack of a better name.
<P>

If you are importing only spectral bands, the header file from any tape may be used as the .ls0 file.  But if you are importing the panchromatic band, use the header file from its tape.  The headers for the spectral bands and the panchromatic band are different; be sure to copy the right one to the .ls0 file before importing.
<P>

When importing the panchromatic band from fast format imagery, specify the band number as "P", like this:
<P>

<DD><EM>i.tape.tm3 input=landsat group=landsat bands=P</EM>
<P>

If the input option is omitted, of if the program cannot find the file for a band asked for, it will prompt for a filename to be entered.

<H3>ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION</H3>
<EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> can extract an entire image or a rectangular region within an image.  Use the rows and cols options to specify the ranges of rows and columns to import.  Before importing the imagery, use the <EM>-e</EM> option to display the number of rows and columns in the image.  Row and column numbers begin at 1.  Row numbers increase from top (north) to bottom (south).  Column numbers increase from left (west) to right (east).  If either option is omitted the full range is used.  The program ignores the current geographic region when importing.  When the import is complete, the current region is set to the region extracted.

<H2>NOTES</H2>
Raster files created will overwrite exiting files with the same names without warning.
<P>

Use the dd(1) command to copy files to tapes.  When copying to 9-track and 8mm tapes, just use the if and of options with a large blocksize.  Use caution when copying data to QIC-150 tapes.  QIC-150 tapes require all files to use record lengths that are multiples of 512.  Files whose lengths are not multiples of 512 must be padded.  Always use dddd with the "sync" option when copying files to QIC-150 tape, like this:
<PRE>
          dd if=filename of=/dev/rst0 obs=32768 conv=sync
</PRE>
obs is the output block size; use any multiple of 512.  The larger the block size the faster the copy will be done. When Landsat imagery files are copied this way they will be padded at the end, making them longer than they originally were.  <EM>i.tape.tm3</EM> will have no problem reading padded files, but other programs may.
