<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program manages display frames on the user's graphics
monitor.  GRASS display programs at run-time connect with
graphics rendering programs.  While the display programs
are identical on every hardware platform, the graphics
rendering programs are (essentially the only GRASS
programs) designed for individual hardware devices. These
rendering programs are managed with the GRASS program
<EM><A HREF="d.mon.html">d.mon</A></B>.</EM> Graphics
are displayed in rectangular frames on whatever graphics
monitor the user is currently directing GRASS display
output to.  These frames are created and managed with this
program, <B>Note</B> that GRASS frame contents are not
retained when one frame covers another.</B> You cannot
shuffle frames from top to bottom and then back again.
They simply define rectangular areas on the screen where
subsequent drawing will occur.  

<P>

<H3>Flags:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>-c</B>
<DD>Creates a new display frame on the graphics monitor. 
<DT><B>-e</B>
<DD>Removes all existing display frames and reinitializes the 
    entire graphics screen 
    (the full-screen display frame). 
<DT><B>-p</B>
<DD>Prints the name of the active frame, in which GRASS display 
    output will appear. 
<DT><B>-s</B>
<DD>Selects a frame for the display of GRASS graphics. This frame is then 
    known as the "active frame". 
<DT><B>-D</B>
<DD>Prints the status of the user's graphics monitor and
    active display frame to standard output. Information
    includes the name and the dimensions of the current frame
    on the graphics monitor, given in the form <EM>bottom</EM>
    top left right</B>. This function is useful for debugging
    output, and for determining display screen coordinates.
</DL>

<P>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>frame=</B><EM>name</B>
<DD>The name of the display frame to be created/selected. 
<DT><B>at=</B><EM>bottom,top,left,right</B>
<DD>Where to place the frame (implies <B>-c</B>). 
    Frame coordinates are stated in the form: 
    <EM>bottom,top,left,right</B>.</EM> The lower-left corner of the graphics 
    monitor always is at location 0,0 while the monitor's upper-right corner 
    is always at 100,100. 
</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

If the user has created multiple display frames that overlap one another, 
whatever the user displays in the active frame will overwrite 
those portions of the underlying frame where these frames overlap.
