<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
SG3d is a tool for viewing a data surface  in  three  dimensions
using  GRASS  on Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.  At
startup, one graphics window and several  interface  windows
are  visible.   Other  interface  windows  pop up when their
appropriate toggle button is clicked in the Menus panel.  To
hide  the pop up windows, click again on their toggle button
in the Menus panel - using the Quit or  Close  options  from
the  window  manager's  menu  bar  will cause the program to
exit.

<H2>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</H2>

<b>Flags</b>
<p>
<PRE>
     <em>-w</em>   Enable writing to script files

     <em>-z</em>   Use site category as Z value (height)  when  displaying
          sites
</PRE>
<p>
<b>Parameters</b>
<p>
<PRE>
     <em>elev </em>
          Raster file for Elevation

     <em>color</em>
          Raster file(s) for Color (1 or 3 files). If three files
          are  given,  the  first  will  be used for the red com-
          ponent, the second for  the  green  component  and  the
          third  for  the blue component. When using three files,
          each file must contain values in the range 0 - 255.

     <em>vector</em>
          Vector overlay file

     <em>sites</em>
          Sites overlay file

     <em>3dview</em>
          3d viewing parameters file

     <em>script</em>
          Automatically run script file

</PRE>
<p>
If the user simply types SG3d without  specifying  parameter
values on the command line, the program will prompt the user
to enter these.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
Environment variables SG3D_WIDTH and SG3D_HEIGHT  may be set
to  define  the width and height (in pixels) of the graphics
window at startup.  All SG3d windows may  be  resized  using
the  window  manager's normal controls at any time.  Text in
the control panels is not scalable,  however,  so  the  text
will disappear if the panel is sized too small.
<p>
Before starting the program, check the resolution and dimen-
sions  of the current GRASS region.  The  current resolution
will determine the best resolution available in  SG3d.   For
speed,  the  entire raster file is loaded into memory, along
with vertex color and other surface information  needed  for
lighting  calculations.  Thus, large dimensions such as 1000
rows x 1000 columns may cause memory problems.  SG3d uses 12
bytes  of  memory  for  each vertex, therefore a 1000 x 1000
image would require 12 megabytes for data alone.
<p>
The GRASS text window is used by SG3d to issue  prompts  and
warnings  and to input filenames.  Therefore, after starting
the program, place the GRASS text window  where  it  can  be
seen and typed into.
<p>
Any sliders and dials used in the control panels have a FINE
ADJUSTMENT:  Hold  down  the Ctrl key while manipulating the
dial or slider for fine control.
<p>
Full documentation detailing the action associated with each
control is available in the <a href="SG3d.ref">tutorial</a>.

<h2>BUGS</h2>
Sometimes very small holes will appear in the  surface.   If
they  appear as points when drawing polygons with grid over-
laid, the bug is in the Graphics Library and  it  should  be
fixed in future versions of IRIX.  If the holes appear along
an edge of a polygon, it is apparently due to the  way  non-
planar  polygons  are  interpreted.   In  this case, drawing
using the triangulate option should make  the  holes  disap-
pear.
