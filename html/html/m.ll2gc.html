<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>m.ll2gc</b></EM>  - Converts geographic coordinates to geocentric coordinates.

<BR>

(GRASS Data Import/Processing Program) 

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>m.ll2gc</B>
<B>lat=</B><EM>dd.mm.ss</EM>{<EM>n</EM>|<EM>s</EM>}
<B>lon=</B><EM>dd.mm.ss</EM>{<EM>e</EM>|<EM>w</EM>}
[<B>h=</B><EM>height</EM>] <B>s=</B><EM>spheroid</EM>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>m.ll2gc</EM> returns geocentric coordinates for
geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Geographic coordinates are in degrees, minutes, and seconds
and must include designation of north or south
{<EM>n</EM>|<EM>s</EM>} and east or west
{<EM>e</EM>|<EM>w</EM>}.  The spheroid on which they are
based must also be entered.  The height (in meters) above
the spheroid is optional.

<P>

The list of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic.  It
may not contain exactly the ones listed below.  To
determine the current list of possible spheroids, type in:

<DL>
<DD><B>m.ll2gc lat=</B><EM>0n</EM> <B>lon=</B><EM>0w</EM> <B>s=</B><EM>help</EM>
</DL>

A list of available spheroids will be printed on the
screen.  If the spheroid desired is not on the list, the
values for the semi-major axis and the eccentricity squared
for the spheroid may be entered in place of a spheroid name
in the following format:

<DL>
<DD><B>s=a=</B><EM>semi-major_axis</EM>,<B>e=</B><EM>eccentricity_squared</EM>
</DL>

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

The distances designated by "x," "y" and "z" are in meters
from the center of the earth. Because the sample point is
on the equator and is at 90 degrees west, two of the three
parameters have a value of zero (i.e., the point is at the
origin of those two dimensions).

<H2>NOTES</H2>

For a brief discussion of spheroids see 

<EM><A HREF="m.ll2u.html">m.ll2u</A></EM>.


<P>

Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) describe the
location of a point on the earth relative to the equator in
the north/south directions and relative to Greenwich in the
east/west directions.  The same point will have different
coordinates depending on the spheroid used as the
approximation of the shape of the earth.  The geocentric
coordinates given here describe the point on the basis of
the same spheroid, but they use the center of the spheroid
as their origin.  This can be thought of as being the
center of the earth, which is why they are called
"geocentric."  Describing the location of a point in a
spheroid requires three points: x, y, and z;  these are
measured out from the center along three different axes.
The distances given are in meters.


<P>

This is an experimental program.  It is part of initial
efforts to incorporate geographic coordinates into GRASS.
