<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>d.icons</b></EM>  - Displays points, as icons, at user-defined locations 
in the active display frame on the graphics monitor. 
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Display Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>d.icons</B>
<BR>
<B>d.icons help</B> 
<BR>
<B>d.icons</B> 
[<B>-r</B>] 
<B>icon=</B><EM>name</EM> 
[<B>color=</B><EM>name</EM>] 
[<B>size=</B><EM>value</EM>] 
[<B>points=</B><EM>name</EM>] 

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>d.icons</EM> graphically displays point (site)
locations as icons in the active frame on the graphics
monitor.  Geographic coordinates are read either from
standard input or from an input file whose name is stated
by the user.  At each site location, a user-defined icon is
displayed.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The user must enter at least the name of an <EM>icon</EM>
file storing a graphic representation of the icon to be
displayed, and the geographic coordinates of the points at
which they will appear.

<P>

The user can run this program either non-interactively or
interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively
if the user specifies the name of an <EM>icon</EM> file and
(optionally) any other desired parameters on the command
line, using the form:
<DL>
<DD>
<B>d.icons</B> 
[<B>-r</B>] 
<B>icon=</B><EM>name</EM> 
[<B>color=</B><EM>name</EM>] 
[<B>size=</B><EM>value</EM>] 
[<B>points=</B><EM>name</EM>] 
</DL>
If the user fails to specify the name of a <EM>points</EM>
file on the command line, the program will prompt the user
to enter geographic coordinates from standard input.  If
the user specifies at least the name of an <EM>icon</EM>
file on the command line, any other parameter values left
unspecified by the user will be set to their default values
(see below).

<P>

Alternately, the user can simply type: 
<DL>
<DD>
<B>d.icons</B> 
</DL>
on the command line, without program arguments. 
In this case, the user will be prompted for 
needed parameter values using the standard 
GRASS user interface described in the manual entry 
for <EM><A HREF="parser.html">parser</A></EM>.
The geographic coordinates at which icons are to be displayed 
can still be input from an input file (<EM>points</EM>) in interactive use. 


<H3>Flag:</H3> 

<DL>
<DT><B>-r</B>
<DD>Coordinates are input in reverse 
order (i.e., as <EM>northing easting</EM>). 
</DL>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>icon=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>The name of an existing file containing a graphic representation 
    of the icon to be drawn. 
    <EM>icon</EM> files can be created by the user 
    using the <EM><A HREF="p.icons.html">p.icons</A></EM> command 
    and are stored under the <EM>icons</EM> directory under the user's 
    current mapset. 
<DT><B>color=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Sets the current icon color to the <EM>name</EM> stated. 
<BR>
    Options: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, 
    gray, white, and black 
<BR>
    Default: white
<DT><B>size=</B><EM>value</EM>
<DD>The icon scaling factor. 
<BR>
    Options: 1-1000 
<BR>
    Default: 1
<DT><B>points=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>The name of a UNIX file containing the geographic
    coordinates of sites at which icons are to be drawn.  Since
    this is a UNIX file, the user should specify the name using
    standard UNIX file naming conventions.  If this file is not
    in the user's current working directory, its pathname
    should be specified.  The file contents should consist of a
    series of geographic coordinates that fall within the
    boundaries of the current geographic region.  Each site
    location should be stated on a separate line as an easting
    and northing (in that order) separated by a single blank
    space.  If no <EM>points</EM> file is specified by the
    user, input is taken from standard input and should be
    given in the same form; to end standard input, type
    <EM>end</EM> (or press control-d).
</DL>

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

An <EM>icons</EM> file contains a graphic representation of the icon 
to be displayed. Here, spaces represent areas of no color, 
and x's represent areas of color. For example, the user might 
construct an icon resembling a cross in the following way: 
<DL>
<DD>
<PRE>
  x 
  x 
xxxxx 
  x 
  x 
  x 
</PRE>
</DL>
This icon might be stored in a file called <EM>cross</EM>
(under the user's $LOCATION/icons directory). If the user
specified that this be the <EM>icon</EM> file used while
running <EM>d.icons</EM>, this cross would then appear in
the <EM>color</EM> and <EM>size</EM> specified by the user,
at each site location named in the <EM>points</EM> file.

<P>

Note: icons are created with the 
<EM><A HREF="p.icons.html">p.icons</A></EM>
command. 

<P>

The <EM>points</EM> file lists the geographic coordinates
of site locations (at which icons will be displayed). This
file should take the form:
<DL>
<DD>
<PRE>
easting northing 
easting northing 
easting northing 
... 
</PRE>
</DL>
If the user sets the <B>-r</B> flag, the order of these
coordinates should be reversed (i.e., coordinates should be
given as <EM>northing easting</EM>).

<P>

If the points file is not specified, then the corrdinates
are read from the keyboard or across a pipe. This feature
allows users to enter the coordinates by hand, or, more
usefully, to get then from another program. For example, to
display icons at locations specified in a sites list:
<DL>
<DD>
<B><A HREF="s.out.ascii.html">s.out.ascii</A></B> 
<EM>name</EM> | <B>d.icons icon=</B><EM>cross</EM>
</DL>
where <EM>name</EM> is the name of a site list, and 
<EM>cross</EM> is the name of an icon.
