<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>d.colors</b></EM> - Allows the user to interactively change the color table 
of a raster map layer displayed on the graphics monitor. 
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Display Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>d.colors</B> 
<BR>
<B>d.colors help</B>

<B>d.colors map=</B><EM>name</B> 

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

A color table file associates specific colors with the categories of a 
raster map layer. The user can change these map category color 
assignments (i.e., change the map's color table) interactively, 
by first displaying the raster map to the graphics monitor and then running 
the program <EM>d.colors</B>.</EM> 
If you have first set <EM><A HREF="d.colormode.html">d.colormode</A></EM> to "float" before displaying the map 
to the graphics monitor, any color changes that you subsequently make 
while in <EM>d.colors</EM> will immediately (and interactively) appear 
on the graphics display. 

<P>
While running <EM>d.colors</B></EM><br> the cursor must be inside the window where the 
execution takes place. When in "float" colormode, the correct colors 
appear on the graphics monitor only if the cursor is inside the monitor. 
To see the correct colors, move the cursor from the execution window 
to inside the graphics monitor, then move back to the window to continue 
making changes. 

<P>
If <EM><A HREF="d.colormode.html">d.colormode</A></EM> is "fixed", any color changes made using 
<EM>d.colors</EM> will not immediately be shown on the graphics display; 
however, any color changes saved will still alter the map's color table and 
will appear next time the raster map layer is redisplayed 
(see <EM><A HREF="d.colormode.html">d.colormode</A></EM> and <EM><A HREF="d.colortable.html">d.colortable</A></B>).</EM> 
Note that some graphics display monitors or drivers cannot support 
interactive color change. 

<P>
The user must first display the relevant raster map layer to the active 
frame on the graphics monitor (e.g., using <EM><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A></EM> or <EM><A HREF="d.display.html">d.display</A></B>)</EM> 
before running <EM>d.colors</B>.</EM> 
The user can then either enter the name of the raster map layer whose 
color table is to be changed on the command line 
(e.g., by typing: <B>d.colors</B> map=</B>soils</B>), 
or type <B>d.colors</B> without program arguments. 
If the user simply types <B>d.colors</B> without program arguments 
on the command line, 
<EM>d.colors</EM> will ask the user to enter the name of an existing raster 
map layer using the standard GRASS interface described in the manual 
entry for <EM><A HREF="parser.html">parser</A></B>.</EM> 

<P>
In either case, the user is then presented with the <EM>d.colors</EM> 
command menu, shown below. 
This menu is the same as the category and color changing portion of 
the <EM><A HREF="d.display.html">d.display</A></EM> menu. 
The <EM>d.colors</EM> commands are listed beneath the Category Pointer Movement, 
Color Modification, Replotting Screen, and Quitting sections below. 
Commands are invoked by typing in the single-key response shown to the left 
below. (Longer descriptions of these commands appear to the right.) 
Results from invoking these commands will be reflected in the Category 
and Category Number sections of the <EM>d.colors</EM> screen. On the 
<EM>d.colors</EM> screen menu, commands appear in the right half of the screen, 
and the current status of categories appears in the left half of the screen.

Changing categories - The keys 
<B>"d, D, u,"</B>
and 
<B>"U"</B>
are used to move to a different category. The lower case letters move up, 
<B>u,</B>
and down, 
<B>d,</B>
the category list one category at a time. The upper case letters move 10 
categories at a time for fast movement. The cursor does wrap between the 
first and last categories. The current category is noted on the text screen 
with an arrow, and is indicated on the graphics screen by a box around the 
current color. 

<P>

Changing colors - The color associated with the current category can be 
changed with the 
<B>"R, r, G, g, B,"</B>
and 
<B>b</B>
keys. The upper case letters increase the intensities of 
red 
<B>R,</B>
green 
<B>G,</B>
and blue 
<B>B</B>
for the current category; the lower case letters decrease the intensities of 
these same colors for the current category. Video devices make all the 
colors of the spectrum by mixing red, green, and blue. For those 
accustomed to red, yellow, and blue being the primary colors, this can 
be confusing. For starters, yellow is made by mixing red and green. The 
intensities are listed on the text screen in as percentages. 

<P>

Keys <B>I</B> and <B>i</B> increase and decrease the
percentage change that each keystroke of one of the color
keys (<EM>R, r, G, g, B, b</EM>) causes in its respective
color. The increase increment is initially set to 10%.
Thus, pressing the <EM>R</EM> key would will increase the
red component of the current category by 10%.

<P>

Highlight - The 
<B>h</B>
key toggles between the current category color and the current 
highlight color. This color is initially black but can be modified as 
above while in highlight mode. Blinking can be accomplished by repeatedly 
striking the 
<B>h</B>
key. When changing to different categories using the movement keys as 
described above, while in highlight mode the category colors will be 
always left showing their actual colors. Only one category is highlighted 
at any one time. 

<P>

Saving the current color table - 
Pressing the <B>c</B> key will save the current color table as you have 
modified it. This table will then be used next time you 
display or paint this raster map layer. 

<P>

Color table toggle - Different types of color tables are suitable for 
different raster map layers. 
The key 
<B>t</B>
flips between the following color tables: red, green, blue color ramp; gray 
scale; smooth changing color wave; random colors; and the saved color table. 

<P>

Color table shift - The entire table is shifted up and down using the 
<B>+</B>
and 
<B>-</B>
keys. 

<P>

Quitting the <EM>d.colors</EM> program - Pressing the
<B>Q</B> key will cause you to quit the <EM>d.colors</EM>
program.  If colors have been modified but not saved,
<EM>d.colors</EM> will ask:
<PRE>
         Colors changed
         Save the changes? (y/n)
</PRE>
The user should type in <B>y</B> to save changes, 
or <B>n</B> to not save changes, before quitting the program. 
If the user types <B>n</B>, the program will ask: 
<PRE>
         Quit anyway? (y/n) 
</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

To see map color changes reflected on the display monitor
as you make them, you must put the monitor in
<EM>float</EM> color mode before running
<EM>d.colors</B>.</EM> It is also wise to erase the display
screen after changing the color mode.

<P>

The map whose color table is to be altered with
<EM>d.colors</EM> must already be on display in the active
display frame on the graphics monitor before
<EM>d.colors</EM> is run. This can be done using the
command <B><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A>
map=</B><EM>name</B> (where <EM>name</EM> is a raster map
layer whose color table the user wishes to alter).

<P>
The user might type the following sequence of commands to interactively 
change the colors of a raster <EM>soils</EM> map: 

<P>
<DL>
<DD> <B><A HREF="d.colormode.html">d.colormode</A> mode=</B><EM>float</EM>
<DD> <B><A HREF="d.erase.html">d.erase</A></B> 
<DD> <B><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A> map=</B><EM>soils</EM> 
<DD> <B>d.colors</B> 
</DL>

<P>
After the user has saved any color changes made with <EM>d.colors</EM> and 
exited the program, the user could then redisplay the <EM>soils</EM> map 
with the new colors by typing: 

<P>
<DL>
<DD> <B><A HREF="d.colormode.html">d.colormode</A></B> mode=</B>fixed</B> 
<DD> <B><A HREF="d.erase.html">d.erase</A></B> 
<DD> <B><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A></B> map=</B>soils</B> 
</DL>

Some color monitors may not support the full range of colors required 
to display all of the map's categories listed in the map's color table. 
However, regardless of whether the user can see the color changes he is 
effecting to a map's color table, any changes to a map's color table 
made with <EM>d.colors</EM> that are saved will appear in the map's color table. 

<P>
Some monitors may not support an interactive color change capability.
