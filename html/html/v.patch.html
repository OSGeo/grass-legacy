<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>v.patch</b></EM>  - Creates a new binary vector map layer
by combining other binary vector map layers.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Vector Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>v.patch</B>

<BR>

<B>v.patch help</B>

<BR>

<B>v.patch</B> 
<B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>[,<EM>name</EM>,...] 
<B>output=</B><EM>name</EM>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.patch</EM> allows the user to combine any number of
vector map layers together to create one composite vector
map layer.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>,<EM>name</EM>, ...

<DD>Name(s) of input vector map(s) to be patched together.

<DT><B>output=</B><EM>name</EM>

<DD>Name assigned to composite "patched" vector output map.
</DL>

<P>

The program will be run non-interactively if the user
specifies the names of the vector map(s) to be patched and
the name of an output file to store the resulting composite
patched vector map on the command line, in the form:

<DL>
<DD>
<B>v.patch</B> <B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>[,<EM>name</EM>,...] 
<B>output=</B><EM>name</EM>
</DL>


<P>

Alternately, if the user runs <EM>v.patch</EM> without
specifying input and output file names on the command line
(by typing simply <B>v.patch</B>), the program will prompt
the user for inputs using the standard GRASS interface
described in the manual entry for

<EM><A HREF="parser.html">parser</A></EM>.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The vector map layers to be patched together must exist in
the user's current mapset search path, and the composite
vector map layer name given must not already exist in the
user's current mapset.


<P>

After running <EM>v.patch</EM>, the header file will
contain only information taken from the first
<EM>input</EM> file name given in the string
<B>input=</B><EM>name,name, ...</EM>, with the exception of
the geographic region's edge information, and the scale and
threshold information.  (The user's current geographic
region settings are ignored; this information is instead
extracted from the vector file headers.) In the new
composite vector map layer, the boundaries of the
geographic region will be expanded to encompass all of the
geographic area included in the map layers being patched,
and the scale will be set equal to the smallest (i.e., most
gross) scale used by any of the patched map layers (this
will affect default node-snapping thresholds).  The map
threshold is calculated automatically from the map scales
given in the file headers, and (currently) is not used
directly.  The composite vector map layer's header will
probably need to be edited; this can be done from within
the GRASS program

<EM><A HREF="v.digit.html">v.digit</A></EM>.


<P>

The GRASS programs 

<EM><A HREF="v.mkgrid.html">v.mkgrid</A></EM> and 

<EM><A HREF="v.mkquads.html">v.mkquads</A></EM> 

can be used to ensure that the borders of the maps to be
patched together align neatly.


<P>

Any vectors that are duplicated among the maps being
patched together (e.g., border lines) will have to be
edited or removed after <EM>v.patch</EM> is run.  Such
editing can be done using

<EM><A HREF="v.digit.html">v.digit</A></EM>.


<P>

After running <EM>v.patch</EM> the user must run 
<EM><A HREF="v.support.html">v.support</A></EM> on
the composite vector map layer in order to create a
<KBD>dig_plus</KBD> (topology) file for it.  At this time,
you can request that a <EM>very</EM> small snapping
threshold be used, to cause the nodes that match up across
vector map layers to snap together without affecting the
integrity of the remainder of the vector map layer.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

The <KBD>dig_cats</KBD> and <KBD>reg</KBD> file information
for the maps being patched together is not copied to the
composite, patched map layer.  The user should therefore
run
<EM><A HREF="v.support.html">v.support</A></EM> 
on the output file produced by this program.
