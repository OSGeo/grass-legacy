<H1>GRASS 5.0 Site Record Format Specification (DRAFT!)</H1>

Site files contain records describing punctual information.
Records are limited to files containing only characters
from the US-ASCII character set.  Records are separated by
a newline character (ASCII 0x0a). There are three types of
records: comment records, header records, and data records.
The formats of each these types of records are described in
the following sections.

<H2>Site Data Record Description</H2>

A site record in the GRASS Sites Format is divided into two
parts, each with a different field separator. Part 1
contains location in 2 or more dimensions and part 2
optionally contains attribute information for this
location. Both types of fields (and thus site records)
are variable length.

<H3>Part 1 of a Site Record: Location</H3>

Part 1 of a site record gives information about location.
The field separator in part 1 of the site record is a
"pipe" (ASCII 0x7c) character.  The last (non-escaped) pipe
signifies the end of part 1 (an escaped character is defined
as one prefixed by a "backslash" (ASCII 0x5c)). Any additional fields are
considered attribute information.

<P>

Each field in part 1 indicates a coordinate in some space.
There must be at least two fields in part 1: the first
describing a geographic easting and the second describing a
geographic northing. These may be in either decimal or
degrees-minutes-second format.

<P>

Additional fields in part 1 are optional but must be stored
in decimal format. They should only be used to represent
coordinate information about some space (e.g., elevation,
time; depending upon how a space is defined).

<H3>Part 2 of a Site Record: Attributes</H3>

Part 2 contains attribute information for the location
given in part 1. The field separator in part 2 of the site
record is a "space" character (ASCII 0x20), except when the
space character is contained in double quotes (ASCII 0x22).
The three types of attributes are: category, decimal, and
string. These attributes may be in any order.  Each of
these attributes have an associated identifier tag defining
the type of attribute in a field:  # (ASCII 0x23), % (ASCII
0x25), and @ (ASCII 0x40), for category, decimal, and string,
respectively.  No space character may immediately follow an
identifier tag.

<H4>Category Attributes</H4>

Categories are a special kind of attribute. They are used
to represent vector or raster categories when sites are
transformed into these different data formats.  There may
be only one category field per record and it must be
prefixed with a "pound" or "number" symbol (#).  Categories
must be integers.

<H4>Decimal Attributes</H4>

Decimal attributes include both integers and floating-point
numbers.  They are prefixed with a "percent" symbol (%).
There may be be zero, one, or more decimal attributes in a
site record.

<H4>String Attributes</H4>

String attributes are fields that contain possibly
non-numeric information and are prefixed with the "at" or
"each" symbol (@). There may be be zero, one, or more
string attributes in a site record. String attributes may
contain space (ASCII 0x20) characters if the entire attribute, not
including the attribute tag (@), is contained within pairs
of "double quotes" ("). String attributes may also contain
double quotes if they are escaped by prefixing a "backslash" (\).

<H4>Default</H4>

If no identifier tag is prefixed (i.e., none of #, %, or @), the
type of attribute defaults to string.

<A NAME="header"><H2>Header and Comment Record Format</H2></A>

In addition to the data record format, the site file
may contain comment lines (records
containing a pound symbol, 0x23, in the first column) and header
lines, both of which are optional. 
Header records must precede all data records while comment records
may occur anywhere within a sites data file.

<P>

There are five types of header records: (1) name, (2)
description, (3) timestamp, (4) label, and (5) format.  
<DL>
<DT>name 

<DD>A name record contains the string "name|" beginning in
column 1 and optionally specifies the name of the database
file.

<DT>description

<DD>A description record contains the string "desc|"
beginning in column 1 and optionally describes the database
file (metadata).

<DT>timestamp

<DD>A timestamp record is special type of metadata
that contains the string "time|" beginning in column 1 and
optionally gives a time and date associated with the entire
sites file.  Valid time data strings are described in the
documentation for the DateTime library (URL?).

<DT>label

<DD>A label record describes what each dimension and
attribute field in site data records represent. It contains
the string "labels|" beginning in column 1 and optionally
contains field descriptions. No special formatting is
required since this record is for user convenience only.

<DT>format

<DD>A format record describes the format of site data
records.  It contains the string "form|" beginning in
column 1 and a special sample data record beginning in
column 6.  The special sample data record is a site data record
(as describe above) containing only field separators and
identifier tags (i.e., all data removed).  

</DL>

All header records are optional.  If present in a sites
data file, header records must occur in the before any data
records in a site file.
