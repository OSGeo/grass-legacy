<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>v.cadlabel</b></EM> - Attaches labels to (binary) vector contour lines
that have been imported to GRASS from DXF format.

<EM>(GRASS Vector Program)</EM>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.cadlabel</EM> attaches labels to index contour lines
by using the index contour lines and lables files that have
been converted from DXF format to GRASS vector format by
the

<EM><A HREF="v.in.dxf.html">v.in.dxf</A></EM> program.

Users have the option of creating either binary or ASCII output
with 
<EM><A HREF="v.in.dxf.html">v.in.dxf</A></EM>.
Since <EM>v.cadlabel</EM> works only on binary vector
files, the ASCII GRASS vector (<KBD>dig_ascii</KBD>) files
that are generated by
<EM><A HREF="v.in.dxf.html">v.in.dxf</A></EM>
must be converted to binary GRASS vector (<KBD>dig</KBD>) files using
the <EM><A HREF="v.in.ascii.html">v.in.ascii</A></EM> 
program before <EM>v.cadlabel</EM> can be executed.


<P>

<EM>v.cadlabel</EM> searches a binary GRASS vector file of
contour lines to find the contour lines that are
closest to each box (contour label) in the binary GRASS
vector file containing contour labels.  The two contour
lines that are closest to a box are tagged with the same
label (an elevation value) as that of the box.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

Program parameters are described below.

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>lines=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>Name of the binary GRASS vector (<KBD>dig</KBD>) file,
imported from DXF format, that contains index contour
lines.

<DT><B>labels=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>Name of the binary GRASS vector (<KBD>dig_att</KBD>)
file, imported from DXF format, that contains index contour
line labels.

</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Because line data that are created in CAD format may have
unsnapped nodes or gaps, <EM>v.cadlabel</EM> will not
always be able to label every index contour line.  Also,
intermediate contour lines that may be contained in the
index contour vector file (because they resided on the same
DXF level as the index contour lines in the DXF design
file) will not be labeled.  Any lines that are not labeled
with <EM>v.cadlabel</EM> can be labeled with the contour
labeling program in
<EM><A HREF="v.digit.html">v.digit</A></EM>.

<P>

If the intermediate contour lines are in a separate GRASS
<KBD>dig</KBD> file, they can be patched to an labeled
index contour file with the GRASS program
<EM><A HREF="v.patch.html">v.patch</A></EM>, 
and then labeled in <EM><A HREF="v.digit.html">v.digit</A></EM>.

<P>

The user does not need to 
<EM><A HREF="v.patch.html">v.patch</A></EM> 
the labels vector file (boxes) to the lines vector file
(contour lines).  The purpose of the labels vector file is
to determine which labels should be assigned to which
contour lines (in the lines vector file) during the
execution of <EM>v.cadlabel</EM>.
