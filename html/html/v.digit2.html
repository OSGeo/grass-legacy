<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>v.digit2</b></EM>  - A menu-driven, highly interactive map
development program used for vector digitizing, editing,
labeling and converting vector data to raster format.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Vector Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>v.digit2</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The GRASS program <EM>v.digit2</EM> is a menu-driven,
highly interactive map development program used for
inputting analog map data into a GRASS vector format.
<EM>v.digit2</EM> contains programs for vector digitizing,
editing, labeling, windowing, and converting vector data to
GRASS raster format.

<P>

<EM>v.digit2</EM>
consists of two parts: an initialization procedure, 
and a multiple menu-driven environment. 

<OL>

<LI>The initialization procedure involves choosing a
digitizer, choosing the name of a vector map layer to
digitize, and, if needed, registering a map to the
digitizing surface.

<LI>The second part of <EM>v.digit2</EM> is a multiple-menu
environment in which digitizing, editing, labeling, and
other options are available. It is within this second
portion of <EM>v.digit2</EM> that all vector creation
occurs.

</OL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<EM>v.digit2</EM> was written to optimize digitizing speed
and performance.  It has a convenient graphic display
format and very convenient windowing capabilities. Features
are color-coded for ease of identification and
verification.  Different color schemes may be user-chosen
to customize a digitizing session.

<P>

Area, line, and point features may be digitized in both
"stream" and "point" modes. Both a mouse and a digitizer
may be used to perform windowing functions.  Labeling and
editing are done from within <EM>v.digit2</EM>, rather than
through a separate set of programs.

<P>

<EM>v.digit2</EM> has capabilities that allow users to
convert vector map layers to GRASS raster format, to
overlay already existing vector map layers onto the feature
being digitized, and set a multitude of parameters to
customize a digitizing session.

<P>

<EM>v.digit2</EM> may be used with or without a digitizer.
Many options are available if no digitizer is used.

<P>

All options available within <EM>v.digit2</EM> are
contained within ten menus.  Movement from menu to menu is
done by chosing the movement options specified at the
bottom of each menu.
