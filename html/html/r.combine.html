<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>r.combine</b></EM>  - Allows 
category values from several raster map layers to be combined. 
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Raster Program)</EM> 

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>r.combine</B> 
<BR>
<B>r.combine</B> &lt; <EM>inputfile</EM> 

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r.combine</EM>
accepts commands that are similar to those used for 
boolean combinations (AND, OR, NOT) in order to 
overlay user-selected groups of categories from 
different raster map layers. 
After the 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
program is started, the users are asked if they want 
the graphic output to go to a color 
graphics monitor. 
If a color graphics monitor is not used, 
the graphic output is displayed on the terminal screen. 
This display is, of course, quite rough. It consists 
of numerals representing the various categories that 
result from the 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
analysis. Following this question, the user will see a 
<KBD>[1]:</KBD>. 
This is the first prompt, and indicates that <EM>r.combine</EM> is ready to 
receive input from the user. 

<P>

The following commands perform operations in 
<EM>r.combine:</EM>

<EM>r.combine</EM>
uses the same colors for all the operating commands. 
This is the 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
color table: 

<PRE>
0 black    4 blue     8 grey           12 blue/grey
1 red      5 purple   9 red/grey       13 purple/grey
2 yellow   6 green    10 yellow/grey   14 green/grey
3 orange   7 white    11 orange/grey   15 dark grey
</PRE>

The user may enter commands either line-by-line from within
<EM>r.combine</EM>, or by typing the commands into a file
which is then read into r.combine using the UNIX
redirection symbol &lt;. The command format is the same for
the two methods. The line-by-line method, however, does not
allow as much flexibility as does use of an input file. If
a line containing a syntax error is entered on the
<EM>r.combine</EM> command line, it is cleared; the line
must then be re-entered in its entirety.  Input files
containing mistakes, however, can easily be modified
(rather than recreated). An input file is especially
advantageous when a more complex series of statements is
input to <EM>r.combine</EM>.

<P>

<EM>r.combine</EM>
uses two types of commands: those which perform 
operations, and those which have some other function. 

<P> 

<EM>r.combine</EM>
can probably best be learned by following examples, so pay 
special attention to those included below with the operating 
command descriptions. Notice two things in particular: 

<OL>
<LI>All parentheses must be closed. 
A raster map layer 
name must often be enclosed within parentheses; each time one 
of the above commands is used, it and its appropriate 
companions must also be enclosed within parentheses. 
<LI>Certain spaces are important. Generally, 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
requires at least one space before an opening parenthesis (except 
when it is the first character in an expression). 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
ignores extra spaces and tab characters. 
</OL>

<H3>OPERATING COMMANDS</H3>

Below is a summary of the syntax of the operating commands, a 
description of each command, and 
examples using the Spearfish sample 
data base. 

<DL>
<DT>NAME 
<BR>
(NAME new_map_name (Expression)) 
<DD>

Allows graphic output to be saved in the raster map layer
<EM>new_map_name</EM>, so that it is available for
additional analysis or for future viewing. The results of
performing the expression in parentheses is then placed
into the named output raster map layer (here,
<EM>new_map_name</EM>).  Note that this means that
<EM>r.combine</EM> may be used to create new raster map
layers from existing ones.  <EM>r.combine</EM>
automatically creates a color table for the new raster map
layers; however, the user should run the GRASS program
<EM><A HREF="r.support.html">r.support</A></EM> 
to fill in category assignments and history information if
the new raster map layer is to be saved for future use in
the mapset.

<P>
example: 
<BR>
<B>(NAME sandstone (GROUP 4 (geology))) </B>
<BR>
The above command will result in the creation of a new raster map layer 
named <EM>sandstone</B>,</EM> noting the 
locations of cells with <EM>geology</EM> category value 4. 
You must then run the GRASS program 
<EM><A HREF="r.support.html">r.support</A></EM> in order 
to label the categories present in the new raster map layer. 

<P>

Resultant categories: 
<PRE>
0  - black: other than sandstone 
1  - red:   sandstone 
</PRE>

<P>
<DT>
GROUP 
<BR>
(GROUP category_values (existing raster map layer)) 
<DD>
Selects out categories of the desired values from the 
existing raster map layer which is indicated in parentheses directly 
after the category grouping. It also works to select out just 
one category from the map layer. 
Any of the following are legal category groupings: 
<PRE>
2 
1-18 
1 2 5-7. 
</PRE>

<P>
example: 
<BR>
<B> (GROUP 1-40 (elevation.255)) </B>
<BR>
Depicts only the area with elevation 1187 meters or less 
(i.e., <EM>elevation</EM> map layer category values 1 through 40 only). 
<BR>
Resultant categories: 
<PRE>
0  - black: elevation &gt; 1187 m 
1  - red  : elevation &lt;= 1187 m 
</PRE>

<P>
example: 
<BR>
<B> (NAME low.hi (GROUP 1-40 238-255 (elevation.255))) </B>
<BR>

Depicts only those areas with elevations of either 1187
meters or less, or in excess of 1787 meters
(<EM>elevation</EM> categories 1-40, and 238-255).  The
graphic output is saved in the new raster map layer called
<EM>low.hi</EM>.

<BR>
Resultant categories: 
<PRE>
0  - black : elevation &gt; 1187 m and &lt; 1787 m 
1  - red   : elevation &lt;= 1187 m and &gt;= 1787 m 
</PRE>

<P>
<DT>
AND 
<BR>
(AND (Expression A) (Expression B)) 
<DD>
Combines two map layers 
and creates a new one; when BOTH of the 
category values associated with the same given 
cell location in the two combined map layers 
are non-zero, a category value of 1 is assigned to that 
cell in the new map layer. If, however, 
<B>either</B>
map layer assigns a category value of zero to the same given 
cell location, the category value associated with this cell's location 
in the resultant map layer also becomes zero. 

<P>

For example, 

<PRE>
raster map  1   2 2 0
                2 1 0
                0 0 0         1 0 0  results
                       AND--&gt; 1 1 0
raster map  2   1 0 1         0 0 0
                1 1 0
                1 1 0
</PRE>

<P>
example: 
<BR>
<B> (AND (GROUP 4 7-9 (geology)) (GROUP 2 (owner))) </B>
<BR>
Depicts the occurrences of categories 
4, 7, 8, and 9 from the map layer 
<EM>geology</EM> whenever they occur on U.S. 
Forest Service property. Results are displayed to the terminal screen. 
<BR>
Resultant categories: 
<PRE>
0  - black : no data occurred any of the 
             raster map layers 
1  - red   : the AND condition is met 
</PRE>

<P>

Note that if neither 
map layer contained any areas of "no data", 
the resultant raster map layer would include only 1's. 

<P>

Example: 
<BR>
<B> (NAME sand (AND (GROUP 4 7-9 (geology)) (GROUP 2 (owner)))) </B>
<BR>
Same as above, except the results are saved in the map layer 
<EM>sand</EM>.

<P>
<DT>
OR 
<BR>
(OR (Expression A) (Expression B)) 
<DD>
Combines two map layers 
and creates a new one; when EITHER of the 
category values associated with the same given 
cell location in the two combined map layers is non-zero, a 
category value of 1 is assigned to that cell in the new map layer. 
If, however, 
<B>both</B>
map layers assign a category value of zero to the same given 
cell location, the category value of this cell in the resultant 
map layer also becomes zero. Only two map layers 
may be combined at one time. For example: 

<PRE>
raster map  1   2 2 0
                2 1 0
                0 0 0          1 1 1  results
                     OR --&gt;    1 1 0
raster map  2   1 0 1          1 1 0
                1 1 0
                1 1 0
</PRE>
</DL>

<P>
Example: 
<BR>
<B> (OR (GROUP 4 7-9 (geology)) (GROUP 2 (owner))) </B>
<BR>
Depicts all occurrences of categories 4, 7, 8, and 9 
from the map layer <EM>geology</EM> as well as showing 
all the land which is U.S. Forest Service property. Results are 
displayed to the terminal screen. 
<BR>
Resultant categories: 
<PRE>
0  - black: this area has neither the values of 4, 
            7, 8, or 9 nor is it on U.S. Forest Service 
            property 
1  - red  : this area meets one or the other of the 
            conditions noted above 
</PRE>

<P>

Note that no distinction is made 
between those places where conditions are met in both map layers 
and where they are met in only one. See the 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
command OVER if it is necessary to make that distinction. 


<P>
<DT>
NOT
<BR>
(NOT (Expression)) 
<DD>
Negates <EM>Expression</EM> in order to define a new map layer 
which contains the opposite of what is defined by 
<EM>Expression</EM>. The new raster map layer will contain 
category values of either 0 or 1. 0 values would 
indicate that the NOT conditions were not met. 
Cell values of 1 would indicate that the NOT conditions were met. 
In order to specify the map layer in which to save the output 
from NOT, use the 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
command NAME. 

<P>
Example: 
<BR>
<B> (NAME rds (NOT (GROUP 0 (roads)))) </B>
<BR>
Areas containing category zero in the existing map layer 
<EM>roads</EM> indicate those locations 
within the data base where roads do not exist. 
Negating that expression leaves us with all other areas  - i.e., those 
locations at which roads do exist. Here, the graphic output is saved in the 
raster map layer named <EM>rds</EM>.
<BR>
Resultant categories: 
<PRE>
0  - black: no roads 
1  - red  : roads 
</PRE>

<P>
The same results could have been obtained with: 
<B> (NAME rds (GROUP 1-5 (roads)))</B>.
NOT is most useful in those cases where it is simpler 
to define something on the basis of what it is not 
than on the basis of what it is. 

<P>
<DT>
OVER 
<BR>
(OVER color (Expression)) or (OVER existing_rastermap color (Expression)) 
<DD>
Performs a <EM>transparent</EM> overlay operation. This means 
that when a map layer 
which depicts some feature in blue is 
overlain with one which depicts a feature in yellow, the resulting 
raster map layer will show areas of overlap in green; areas in the two 
raster map layer that do not overlap other areas maintain their 
original colors (i.e., yellow or blue). 

<P>

OVER may be run with or without an existing map layer name. 
If the user does not specify an existing raster map layer 
name, OVER applies the color specified to the 
expression in parentheses and displays the results. If an existing 
raster map layer name is specified, OVER applies the color to 
the expression (just as before) and then overlays the results on top of 
the existing raster map layer. 
In order to make sense of the colors which result, use only those existing 
map layers created using OVER. 

<P>

OVER allows the user to specify just four colors: 
<PRE>
 color value
 red     1
 yellow  2
 blue    4
 grey    8
</PRE>

These four colors are then combined to form other colors.
The number of progressive overlays allowed is limited to
four (one for each of the basic colors above). The actual
number of colors on the resultant raster map layer,
however, varies depending on the distribution of the
features and on the interaction of the features from the
different map layers which are overlain. When two or more
of these colors are overlain, new colors are created. The
numerical values associated with the colors above are
significant, in that the values of any additional colors
created reflect the sum of two or more of the four above.
These overlain color values appear on the resultant overlay
as <EM>cell</EM> (category) values. The user should know
what these values represent in order to know what category
information is to be associated with the new map layer
(entered using the GRASS <EM><A
HREF="r.support.html">r.support</A></EM> command), and
to know the significance of this and subsequent analyses
involving the new map layer.

<P>

Any of these colors and category values may result from 
OVER. Note that this is the same as the 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
color table listed above. 

<PRE>
0 black   4 blue    8 grey          12 blue/grey
1 red     5 purple  9 red/grey      13 purple/grey
2 yellow  6 green   10 yellow/grey  14 green/grey
3 orange  7 white   11 orange/grey  15 dark grey
</PRE>

The syntax for OVER 
makes no provision for a new raster map layer 
name. It is necessary to use the 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
operator NAME to specify a new raster map layer 
name in which to save 
the graphic output generated by OVER. If the user runs OVER without 
specifying an output raster map layer name, 
output is displayed to the terminal. 
However, this output is available for future use only if it is saved 
using the NAME command. 

<P>
example: 
<BR>
<B> (NAME park.or.priv (OVER red (GROUP 1 (owner)))) </B>
<BR>

The new raster map layer <EM>park.or.priv</EM> displays
private land (i.e., category 1 of the raster map layer
<EM>owner</EM>) in red, and displays U.S. Forest Service
land (i.e., "no data" areas within the <EM>owner</EM> map
layer) as black.
<BR>
Resultant categories: 
<PRE>
0  - black: park 
1  - red  : private land 
</PRE>

<P>
example: 
<BR>
<B> (NAME roads.or.not (OVER park.or.priv yellow (GROUP 0 (roads)))) </B>
<BR>
Category 0 in the map layer 
<EM>roads</EM> is overlain in yellow on top of the <EM>park.or.priv</EM> 
map layer created above. The output is placed in a new map layer 
named <EM>roads.or.not</B>.</EM> 
<BR>
Resultant categories in <EM>roads.or.not</EM> are: 
<PRE>
0  - black  : park; road 
1  - red    : private; road 
2  - yellow : park; no road 
3  - orange : private; no road 
</PRE>

<P>

example: 
<BR>
<B> (NAME low.elev (OVER park.or.priv blue 
(GROUP 1-19 (elevation.255)))) </B>
<BR>
The elevation categories of 1123 meters or less from the 
map layer
<EM>elevation.255</EM> are assigned the color blue and 
then overlain on <EM>park.or.priv</EM> (generated in the previous example). 
<BR>
Resultant categories in the new map layer <EM>low.elev</EM> are: 
<PRE>
0  - black  : park; &gt; 1123 m 
1  - red    : private; &gt; 1123m 
4  - blue   : park; &lt;=</B> 1123 m 
5  - purple : private; &lt;=</B> 1123m 
</PRE>
Note how category 5 is the sum of red (1) + blue (4) (i.e., the 
intersection of areas containing low elevations and private lands 
with roads). 

<P>
<DT>
COVER 
<BR>
(COVER existing_map (Expression)) 
<DD>
Performs an <EM>opaque</EM> overlay operation. This 
means that where the top map layer contains "holes" (cell category 
values of 0), the bottom map layer will show through. Where the top 
map layer contains information on a feature, it will cover (substitute its 
category value for) whatever is below it. The top map layer 
is that which is defined by <EM>Expression</B>.</EM> The bottom map layer 
is <EM>existing_map</B>;</EM> this map layer must already exist. 

<P>

The user does not specify colors with COVER. 
COVER uses the default color table that is listed 
above with OVER. 
Colors are assigned starting with the lower map layer. 
The category values are assigned the color 
from the table that corresponds with that value. 
For example, 1 would be red; 2, yellow; 3, orange, etc. 
Moving to the upper map layer COVER starts wherever 
it left off after the lower one. If the highest value of the lower 
map layer was 5, then all 
non-zero (i.e., places where a feature exists) cells 
of the upper map layer would be assigned the value of 6 
(green). Note that if, in this case, the upper map layer 
did not have any cells of value zero, then 
the entire resulting new map layer would be green. The upper 
map layer would have been assigned the value 6 and 
would have completely covered that which was below it. 

<P>
This is what happens: 
<PRE>
Expression           1 1 1 0
 (top raster map)    1 1 0 0
                     0 0 0 0      6 6 6 0   result
                             --&gt;  6 6 2 0
oldmap               2 5 0 0      5 5 2 2
 (bottom raster map) 0 5 2 0
                     5 5 2 2
</PRE>

As many map layers may be overlain as is desired. 
However, there is a practical limit on the number of map layers 
that can be used while still generating sensible output. 
That number depends on the features involved in each map layer, 
and how many 
cells within the upper (overlying) map layers contain 
category values of zero (holes through 
which underlying data can be seen). 

<P>
COVER has no provision for saving graphic output. Use the 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
command NAME to save output in a raster map layer. 

<P>

Example: 
<BR>
<B>(NAME</B> lo.elev (COVER owner (GROUP 1-19 (elevation.255)))) </B> 
<BR>
The categories that indicate elevation of 1123 meters or 
less are placed on top of the existing map layer 
<EM>owner</EM>. Output is saved in <EM>lo.elev</EM>.
<BR>
Resultant categories: 
<PRE>
1  - red    : private ownership; elev &gt; 1123 m 
2  - yellow : park property; elev &gt; 1123 m 
3  - orange : park or private; elev &lt;=</B> 1123 m 
</PRE>

<P>

Example: 
<BR>
<B>(NAME</B> sand.lo (COVER lo.elev (GROUP 4 (geology)))) </B> 
<BR>
Category 4 of <EM>geology</EM> (sandstone) is placed on top 
of <EM>lo.elev</EM>, the raster map layer created in the previous example. 
The output is saved in <EM>sand.lo</EM>.
<BR>
Resultant categories: 
<PRE>
1  - red    : private ownership; elev &gt; 1123 m; 
              no sandstone 
2  - yellow : park property; elev &gt; 1123 m ; 
              no sandstone 
3  - orange : park or private; elev &lt;= 1123 m; 
              no sandstone 
4  - blue   : park or private; any elev; sandstone 
</PRE>

<H3>ADDITIONAL COMMANDS</H3>

<EM>r.combine</EM>
also contains a number of commands which are not used for 
operations, but serve a variety of other functions. 
Additional commands: 
<PRE>

</PRE>

<DL>
<DT>
QUIT 
<DD>
Allows the user to exit from
<EM>r.combine</EM>
while remaining within the GRASS session. 

<P>
<DT>
CATS 
<BR>
CATS raster map 
<DD>
Gives user an on-line listing of categories and labels for the 
map layer specified. For example: 
<KBD>[1]:</KBD><B>CATS owner</B>

<P>
<DT>
EXP 
<BR>
EXP expression number 
<DD>
During an 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
session, each completed expression and command is assigned a number. 
This number may be used to reference the expression to which it 
is assigned; this means that the user can substitute the <EM>number</EM> of 
the expression for the expression itself. 

<P>

For example: 
<BR>
<KBD>[4]:</KBD><B>(GROUP 5 (geology))</B>
<BR>
<KBD>[5]:</KBD><B>(NAME limestone (EXP 4))</B>
<BR>
Use the UNIX history mechanism (explained below) to determine the 
specific numbers associated with particular expressions in your current 
<EM>r.combine</EM> session. 

<DT>!
<BR> 
!shell command 
<DD>
Allows user to temporarily suspend 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
and go run another command, as in the two examples below: 
<PRE>
!vi input 
!g.list type=rast
</PRE>

<P>
Unless otherwise specified by the user, when a file is created using a 
system editor (like <EM>vi</EM>) from within 
<EM>r.combine,</EM>
this file will be placed in the user's mapset under 
the COMBINE directory. 
After the command is completed, control returns to 
<EM>r.combine</EM>.

<P>
<DT>
&lt;
<BR>
&lt; input filename
<DD>
Takes input from the specified <EM>filename</EM> containing 
<EM>r.combine</EM>
commands. The user, of course, must previously have entered the commands 
into this named input file. If no pathname is given, the input file 
is assumed to be in the user's mapset under the COMBINE directory. 
For example, the user would perform the following steps to redirect 
input from the file <EM>comb.in</EM> into the <EM>r.combine</EM> program 
(while within <EM>r.combine</EM>):

<P>

First, the user would create the file: <B> !vi comb.in</B> 
<BR>
Second, the user would direct <EM>r.combine</EM> to take its input 
from the <BR> file: <B> &lt; comb.in</B>

within the current <EM>r.combine</EM> session, and the numbers associated 
with the execution of these commands. 

<P>
<DT>
HELP 
<BR>
HELP command 
<DD>
An on-line help facility for <EM>r.combine</EM> commands only. Type in the 
name of the <EM>r.combine</EM> command for which help is needed, to see 
the entry for that command. 

<P>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

In all of the above examples, only a single line of input
was provided to <EM>r.combine</EM>. However, since
<EM>r.combine</EM> conveniently ignores extra spaces and
tabs, it is possible to type input to <EM>r.combine</EM> in
the manner outlined below. Users may find this to more
clearly exhibit the relationships involved and parentheses
needed. This can be typed as shown below either directly at
the <EM>r.combine</EM> command line, or redirected into
<EM>r.combine</EM> from an already existing file.

<P>
example: 
<PRE>
(NAME good.place
       (AND
                (OR
                        (GROUP 1 2 5 (geology))
                        (GROUP 1-5 (elevation.255))
                )
                (NOT
                        (GROUP 1-4 (landuse))
                )
      )
)
</PRE>

Such involved input to <EM>r.combine</EM> might conveniently be 
typed into an input file, and then input to <EM>r.combine</EM> 
using the UNIX redirection mechanism <B>&lt;</B>.
