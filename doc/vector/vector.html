<h2>GRASS 5.7 vector architecture features </h2>

The new GRASS 5.7 vector architecture implementation covers 
the new 3D, multi-attribute, multi-layer vector features. 
Current available are:   

<ul>
<li> multi-layer: features in one vector may represent more layers and 
    may be linked to more external tables;
<li> multi-attribute: attributes saved in external Relational Database Management 
      System (RDBMS) connected through DBMI library and drivers;
<li> 2D and 3D vector geometry with topology;
<li> multi-format: external data formats supported (SHAPE- file, PostGRASS etc.);
<li> portability: platform independent internal format for 32bit,
      64bit etc. computer architectures;
<li> integrated Directed Graph Library: support for vector network analysis
<li> spatial index: based on R-tree method for fast vector geometry access
</ul>

<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
The new format is very similar to old GRASS 4.x (5.0/5.3) vector format.
<P>
GRASS vector maps are stored in an arc-node representation, consisting of 
curves called arcs. An arc is stored as a series of x,y,z coordinate pairs.
The two endpoints of an arc are called nodes. Two consecutive x,y,z pairs 
define an arc segment. The user specifies the type on input to GRASS,
GRASS doesn't decide. GRASS allows for the line definition which allows 
for the multiple type to co-exist in the same map. Centroid are assigned to
area it is within/inside (geometrically). An area is identified by an x,y,z
centroid point geometrically inside with a category number. This identifies
the area. Such centroids are stored in the same binary 'coor' file with 
other primitives.
Each element may have none, one or more categories (cats). More cats are 
distinguished by field number (field). Single and multi-category support 
on modules level is implemented.
Z-coordinate is optional and both 2d and 3d files may be written. 


<h3>Topology general characteristics</h3>

<ol>
<li> geometry and attributes are stored separately
   (don't read both if it is not necessary (usually it is not))
<li> the format is topological (areas build from boundaries)
</ol>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="dir">Directory structure</A></H2>

Directory structure and file names are a bit changed.
All vector files for one vector map are stored in one
directory:<BR>
<B>$MAPSET/vector/vector_name/</B> <BR>
This directory contains these files:<BR><BR>
<ul>
<li><b>coor</b> - binary file, coordinates [former dig/ file]
<li><b>topo</b> - binary file, topology [former dig_plus/ file]
<li><b>sidx</b> - binary file, spatial index 
<li><b>head</b> - text file, header information [former part of dig/ file]
<li><b>dbln</b> - text file, link(s) to attribute table(s) <br>
<li><b>hist</b> - text file, vector map change history <br>
</ul>

[docs missing]
<P>
Topology is written for native format, pseudo-topology is
written for PostGRASS, SHAPE-link.

<pre>
/* Vector types used in memory on run time - may change */
#define GV_POINT      0x01
#define GV_LINE       0x02
#define GV_BOUNDARY   0x04
#define GV_CENTROID   0x08
#define GV_FACE       0x10
#define GV_KERNEL     0x20
#define GV_AREA       0x40
</pre>

Face and kernel are 3D equivalents of boundary and centroid, but there 
is no support (yet) for 3D topology (volumes). The only current use of 
face is possibility to display vertical planes in NVIZ.

<pre>
/* Topology level details */
#define GV_BUILD_NONE  0
#define GV_BUILD_BASE  1
#define GV_BUILD_AREAS  2
#define GV_BUILD_ATTACH_ISLES 3  /* Attach islands to areas */
#define GV_BUILD_CENTROIDS 4 /* Assign centroids to areas */
#define GV_BUILD_ALL GV_BUILD_CENTROIDS
</pre>

GV_BOUNDARY contains geometry and it is used to build areas.
GV_LINE cannot form an area.
<h3>Topology Example 1:</h3>

A polygon may be formed by many boundaries (more primitives but connected).
One boundary is shared by adjacent areas.

<pre>
+--1--+--5--+
|     |     |
2  A  4  B  6
|     |     |
+--3--+--7--+

1,2,3,4,5,6,7 = 7 boundaries (primitives)
A,B = 2 areas
</pre>


<h3>Topology Example 2:</h3>

This is handled correctly in GRASS: A can be filled, B filled differently.

<pre>
+---------+
|    A    |
+-----+   |
|  B  |   |
+-----+   |
|         |
+---------+
</pre>

In GRASS, whenever 'inner' ring touches the boundary of outside area, even in
one point, it is no more 'inner' ring, it is simply another area.
A, B above can never be exported from GRASS as polygon A with inner ring B
because there are only 2 areas A and B and no island.


<h3>Topology Example 3:</h3>

v.in.ogr/v.clean can identify dangles and change the type from boundary
to line (in TIGER data for example). 
Distinction between line and boundary isn't important only for dangles. Example:

<pre>
+-----+-----+
|     .     |
|     .     |
+.....+.....+
|     .     |
|  x  .     |
+-----+-----+

----  road + boundary of one parcel => type boundary
....  road => type line
x     parcel centroid (identifies whole area)
</pre>

Because lines are not used to build areas, we have only one area/centroid,
instead of 4 which would be necessary in TIGER.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="lib">Library</A></H2>

For historical reasons, there are two libraries for vector: <BR><BR>

diglib, dig_*(), DIGLIB, libdig.a, digit library, grass3.x, 4.x<BR>
and<BR>
Vlib, Vect_*(), VECTLIB_REAL, libvect.a, vector library, grass4.x<BR><BR>

Vector library was introduced in grass4.0 to hide vector files' formats
and structures. 
In GRASS 5.7 everything is accessed via Vect_* functions, for example:
<PRE>
    xx = Map.Att[Map.Area[area_num].att].x;
</PRE>by new function<PRE>
    Vect_get_area_centroid()
    Vect_get_centroid_coor()

</PRE>

And many, many others ...

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="attr">Attributes</A></H2>

dig_cats files are not used any more and
vectors' attributes are stored in external database.
Connection with database is done through drivers based on DBMI library
(odbc, dbf, Postgres and MySQL drivers are available at this time). Records in table
are linked to vector entities by field and category number. 
The field identifies table and the category identifies record.
I.e. for unique combination map+mapset+field+category exists one
unique combination driver+database+table+row.
<P>
For each pair <B>map + field</B> must be defined <B>table, key column,
database, driver</B>. This definition must be written to $MAPSET/DB text file.
Each row in DB file contains names separated by spaces in following order
([] - optional): <BR><BR>

<B>map[@mapset] field table [key [database [driver]]] </B><BR><BR>

If key, database or driver are omited (on second and higher row only)
last definition is used. Definition from DB file in other mapset
may be overwritten by definition in current mapset if mapset is specified 
with map name.
<P>
Wild cards <B>*</B> and <B>?</B> may be used in map and mapset names.
<P>
Variables <B>$GISDBASE, $LOCATION, $MAPSET, $MAP, $FIELD</B>
may be used in table, key, database and driver names. Note that
$MAPSET is not current mapset but mapset of the map the rule is defined for.

<P>Note that features in GRASS vector may have attributes
in different tables or may be without attributes. Boundaries
forms areas but it may happen that some boundaries are not closed
(such boundaries would not appear in polygon layer).
Boundaries may have attributes. All types may be mixed in one vector.
<P>
Link to the table is permanent and it is stored in 'dbln' file in vector
directory. Tables are considered to be a part of the vector and g.remove,
for example, deletes linked tables of the vector.
Attributes must be joined with geometry.

<P>
<H3>Examples:</H3>
Examples are written mostly for dbf driver where database is full path to
directory with dbf files and table name is name of dbf file without
.dbf extension.
<P>
<PRE><B>* 1 tbl id $GISDBASE/$LOCATION/$MAPSET/vector/$MAP dbf</B></PRE>
This definition says that entities with category of field 1 are linked
to dbf tables with names tbl.dbf saved in vector directories of each map.<BR><BR>

<PRE><B>* 1 $MAP id $GISDBASE/$LOCATION/$MAPSET/dbf dbf</B></PRE> 
Similar as above but all dbf files are in one directory dbf/ in mapset
and names of dbf files are $MAP.dbf<BR><BR>

<PRE><B>water* 1 rivers id /home/grass/dbf dbf</B>
<B>water* 2 lakes lakeid /home/guser/mydb</B>
<B>trans* 1 roads key basedb odbc</B>
<B>trans* 5 rails</B></PRE>
These definitions defines more fields for one map i.e. in one map may be more
features linked to more tables. Definition on first 2 rows are applied for example
on maps water1, water2, ... so that more maps may share one table.<BR><BR>

<PRE><B>water@PERMANENT 1 myrivers id /home/guser/mydbf dbf</B></PRE>
This definion overwrites definition saved in PERMANENT/DB and 
links map from PERMANENT mapset to user's table.<BR><BR>

<P>
Modules should be written so that connections to database for each
vector field are independent. It should be possible to read attributes
of input map from one database and write to some other and even with
some other driver (should not be such problem). 

<P>
There are open questions however. For example how to distinguish when
new table should be written and when not. For example definitions:<BR>
river 1 river id water odbc<BR>
river.backup* 1 NONE<BR>
could be used to say that tables should not be copied for backups of
map river because table is stored in reliable RDBMS.

Each module which modifies and writes data must read from input= and
write to output= so that data may not be lost. For example v.spag
works on map= at in grass5.0 but if program (system) crashes or treshold was 
specified incorrectly and vector was not backuped, data are lost. 
In this case map= option should be replaced by input= and output=
