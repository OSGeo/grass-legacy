How the GRASS Webserver and related infrastructure works

written by M. Neteler, $Date$


== GRASS Web server ==

Maintainer: M. Neteler

* http://grass.itc.it
* 3Ghz Dual Core Pentium, sponsored by ITC-irst, Trento, Italy
* Apache Server with PHP
* OS: RHEL4 with overnight security updates

* Web pages:
** hosted in the CVS server (developers can modify), downloaded to Web server
   via cronjob every three hours
** written in simple PHP/HTML (just include() statement for menus)
** mirrored to selected tier-1 sites via rsync (hardcoded IPs to avoid
   that too many sites connect)
** tier-1 sites are mirrored via rsync to tier-2 mirrors (no hardcoded IPs)
** RSS feed: rss.xml file stored in CVS-Web

* Weekly snapshots (generated Saturday morning Italian time):
** Source code tarball of CVS HEAD
** Linux binary snapshot is compiled
*** GRASS is compiled with GDAL, PROJ, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, FFTW, C++ support
*** binary tar.gz is moved into Web space

* GRASS user manual HTML:
** generated during compilation of weekly Linux binary snapshot

* GRASS programmer's manual:
** HTML: job manually run by M Neteler from time to time (not on grass.itc.it)
** PDF: currently broken since PDFs aren't created for unknown reasons in cronjob

* i18N translation statistics:
** generated during compilation of Linux binary snapshot, stats of
   (cd locale; make) are extracted into text file
** text file parsed by PHP page and shown as table

* GRASS 5 tutorial (generated Saturday morning Italian time):
** downloaded to Web server via cronjob
** built with docbook

* GRASS user map
** GDF is creating png output via mapserver
** fetched every three hours via cronjob from http://mapserver.gdf-hannover.de/tmp/

* GRASS-Mapserver demo
** currently broken after grass.itc.it update

* Search engine
** htdig runs once a week
** searchgrass.inc contains selective entries (CVS-Web)

* FTP server
** no longer available due to security risk

* Mailman mailing lists + Spam filtering
** Mailman is doing the job, only registered users can post
** each incoming email first passes 'bogofilter', then a set of handwritten
   procmail rules filter standard rubbish
** 'bogofilter' is autotrained
** the few spams which arrive through the bugtracker or into the open 'weblist'
   are manually added to /var/mail/bogofilter-train-as-spam folder
** bogofilter learn script which reads /var/mail/bogofilter-train-as-spam and
   /var/mail/bogofilter-train-as-ham runs every night via cronjob

* Backup of mailing lists (mbox files)
** manually done by MN and Intevation (into freegis.org FTP space)

* Web statistics
** Webalizer (http://grass.itc.it/webalizer/) runs daily as cronjob
** Sitemeter: http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&s=s24grassgis

Summary: The system should run almost autonomous.

== GRASS Mailing lists ==

Maintainer: Markus Neteler

Available lists:
grass-abm  	Integration of GRASS with JAVA based agent based modeling (ABM)
grass-announce 	GRASS announcements (moderated by M. Neteler)
grass-commit 	Mailing list to distribute GRASS-CVS commits (limited posters)
grass-dev 	GRASS GIS Development mailing list
grass-qa 	GRASS Quality Assessment and monitoring list (limited posters)
grass-psc 	GRASS-PSC (Project Steering Committee) list
grassgui 	GRASSGUI mailing list
grassuser 	GRASS user list
nvizlist 	List to discuss GRASS/NVIZ visualization tools
sqlgrass 	GRASS and SQL support
statsgrass 	GRASS and statistical software
translations 	Translation of GRASS (i18N)
weblist 	GRASS website mailing list
winGRASS 	winGRASS - Using GRASS on MS-Windows systems mailing list

Notes:
* The old user list at Baylor university, Texas, USA is still functional. The
  new grassuser list at ITC-irst is subscribed at Baylor to transport messages
  posted there to the new list.
* grass-announce:
  * posts to 'announce AT grass.osgeo.org'. The latter is moderated by M. Neteler
  * has monthly password reminder disabled to avoid leakage into publicly archived
    lists such as 'announce AT grass.osgeo.org'
* grass-qa is receiving posts from the GRASS Quality Control System at
  Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Canada. Not open for other postings.
* grass-commit is receiving posts from the GRASS CVS server at intevation.de.
  Not open for other postings.
* weblist is an open list (posting without subscription possible) with spam filter


== GRASS Wiki ==

Maintainer: Markus Neteler

* http://grass.gdf-hannover.de
* Mediawiki, sponsored by GDF Hannover, Germany
* requires registration to keep spammers out

Summary: The system should run almost autonomous. An eye must be
         be kept on people trying to spam the site

Web based client: http://irc.telascience.org/

* channel owner: Alessandro Frigeri <afrigeri unipg.it> ("geoalf")

== GRASS Bugtracker ==

Maintainer: Bernhard Reiter, Jan-Oliver Wagner (gforce)
            Maciej Sieczka (bugs generally), with help from
             - Jachym Cepicky - code patches,
             - Scott Mitchell - website patches,
             - Martin Landa   - doc patches

New bugtracker (Jan 2007 - today):
  * http://wald.intevation.org/tracker/?group_id=21
  * gforce, sponsored by Intevation GmbH, Germany
  * spamassasin spamfilter locally, bogofilter at grass-dev list
  * needs 'noreply*wald.intevation.org' to be enabled as alias in Mailman
