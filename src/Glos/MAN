NAME
     Glos - Line of sight analysis tool
     (G	Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Glos elev_layer=name [patt_layer=name] east=value
	  north=value [obs_elev=value] [max_dist=value]
	  out_layer=name

DESCRIPTION
     Glos generates an output map on which the cells that are
     visible from a user-specified observer location are marked
     with integer values that represent	the vertical angle (in
     degrees) required to see those cells. The input to	the
     program is	as follows:

     elev_layer
	  File name of a grid cell layer containing elevation
	  data.

     patt_layer
	  File name of a 1/0 grid cell map layer which has cells
	  within the areas of interest coded with 1 while the
	  rest are coded with '0'. If omitted, the analysis will
	  be performed for the whole area within a certain
	  distance of the viewing point	inside the database
	  window.

     east, north
	  Coordinates identifying the desired location of the
	  viewing point.

     obs_elev
	  Height of the	observer (in meters) above the viewing
	  point's elevation.  If omitted, a default value of
	  1.75m	is assumed.

     max_dist
	  Maximum distance (in meters) from the	viewing	point
	  inside of which the line of sight analysis will be
	  performed. The grid cells outside this distance range
	  are considered not visible. If omitted, a default maximum
	  distance of 100 grid cells is	assumed.

     out_layer
	  File name of the data	layer in which the results will
	  be stored.  The viewpoint will have a value of 180. 
	  Non-visible points will have value of zero (0). Visible
	  points will have the value of the angle which they are seen.

NOTES
     For accurate results, the program must be run with	the
     window resolution equal to	the resolution of the data.

     It	is advisable to	use a 'pattern layer' which identifies
     the areas of interest in which the	line of	sight analysis is
     required.	Such a measure will reduce the time taken by the
     program to	run.
