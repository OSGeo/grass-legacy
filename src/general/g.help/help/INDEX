              WELCOME TO THE GRASS 4.1 ON-LINE HELP SYSTEM

The GRASS On-line Help System provides information about GRASS and its
many capabilities.  Listed below are the main "topic areas" covered in
this help system.  Each area provides general information about a
a particular topic, lists the GRASS commands associated with that
topic and gives the user the option to explore the topic further by
accessing more detailed information.  Two on-line resources are
available: a glossary of GIS/GRASS terms and the GRASS User's Reference
Manual.
