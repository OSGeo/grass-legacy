DRAFT
.AB
This document lists the currently running programs associated with version 4.0
of the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS), developed at the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Laboratory
(USA-CERL) in Champaign, IL.

.NH 0
GRASS
.PP
GRASS is a public domain image processing and geographic information system
(GIS), written in the C programming language and running under the UNIX
operating system.  It was originally designed and developed by researchers in
USACERL's Environmental Division to assist land managers at military
installations.
GRASS is now used by a wide variety of public and private agencies,
including the Soil Conservation Service, National Park Service, U.S. Geological
Survey, and many others.  Some GRASS programs are contributed by these
agencies and others.  The system continues to be developed at USACERL.
.PP
GRASS version 4.0 includes roughly 270 commands, which adhere to
the following naming conventions:
.DS
\fIPrefix\fR:
 d.   - Display commands
 g.   - General file management	commands
 i.   - Imagery commands
 m.   - Data Import/Processing commands
 p.   - Paint/Print commands
 r.   - Raster data commands
 s.   - Sites data commands
 v.   - Vector data commands

\fISuffix\fR:
  .sh - Shell scripts (macros)
.DE
This naming scheme indicates the data type (raster, vector, sites) on which
a command operates, or the general functional area (display, imagery,
data import/processing, general purpose) in which a command falls,
or whether a command is a UNIX shell script macro.
.bp

.PP
In this paper, and in the GRASS on-line help system (accessed by typing
\fBg.help\fR while running GRASS), commands
are listed under their respective functional areas.
The functional areas described here are as follows:
.DS
 1 - General File Management
 2 - "Window" Management
 3 - Extracting Data from Magnetic Tape
 4 - Data Conversion: Importing and Exporting Data
 5 - Interfaces between GRASS and other Software
 6 - Digitizing and Map Development
 7 - Image Processing
 8 - Analyzing Data in GRASS
 9 - Map Display
10 - Printing Maps
11 - Report Generation
12 - Macro Development

.NH 1
General File Management Commands
.PP
The following GRASS commands perform general management functions.
They are designed to assist in the management of files and data and
to provide access to various GRASS help features.

.NH 1
"Window" Management
.PP
These commands deal with the management of the two types of 'windows'
available in GRASS:  graphics display frames and geographic regions.
.NH 2
Management of Graphics Display Frames
.PP
After the user has started and selected a graphics monitor for output
(using the \fId.mon\fR command), the user can subdivide the monitor
into different "frames", and display different GRASS outputs in each frame.
For example, the GRASS macro \fI3d.view.sh\fR divides the monitor into
nine frames to demonstrate the 3-d viewing function of GRASS.
.br
The following commands are used to manage the frames in which graphics
are displayed on the user's graphics display device (monitor).
These commands affect only the display of graphics, and do not alter the
user's data.  In past GRASS releases, "graphics frames" were referred to
as "graphics windows";  the latter term is now obsolete.

end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
Defining/Management of the Geographic Region  
.PP
The commands listed below can be used to modify the settings of the user's
geographic region.  This settings of this region define the geographic
boundaries, map projection, coordinate system, and resolution of a data set.
GRASS commands commonly ignore data falling outside of this region.
For example, when raster analysis programs are run on map layers, only
those map areas that fall inside the user's current geographic region
will be analyzed and included in the resultant map layer.
In previous GRASS releases, the geographic region definition was referred to
as the "geographic window";  the latter term is now obsolete.

.NH 1
Extracting Data from Magnetic Tapes
.PP
Several GRASS commands exist to examine and extract specific types of
data from magnetic tape.  Some of these programs are listed below.
.NH 2
Examining, Extracting and Rotating Elevation Tape Data
.PP
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA)
distribute digital elevation data at several resolutions and in different tape
formats.  These data are referred to as digital elevation models (DEMs)
and digital terrain elevation data (DTED).  The GRASS programs listed below
extract this data from 1/2" magnetic tape, list tape contents, rotate
the data, and "flip" the data.  USACERL distributes brief papers that
distinguish elevation data types and detail the sequence of GRASS commands
relevant to each.
EOF

end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
Extracting Imagery Data
.PP
Several GRASS commands are also available to extract specific forms of
satellite imagery data from magnetic tape.  The below commands extract
LANDSAT multi-spectral scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), and other
(e.g., SPOT) satellite data, as well as header information, from tape.
The \fIGRASS Imagery Tutorial\fR distributed by USACERL discusses imagery data
and details the logical sequence of GRASS commands relevant to these different
data forms.

.NH 1
Data Conversion: Importing and Exporting Data
.PP
The commands listed below are useful to those importing and exporting data
to and from GRASS.  They perform ASCII/binary data conversions,
raster, vector, and sites data format conversions, GRASS/other data format
conversions, and map coordinate system and map projection conversions.
.NH 2
Moving Data to Another Computer - ASCII/Binary Conversions
.PP
These commands  assist in ASCII/binary conversion of data.
Specifically, commands with the .ascii extension
bring data in from ASCII (to binary) and out to ASCII (from binary).
Those with a .dlg extension
bring data in from DLG-3 Optional format (to GRASS vector format) and
out to DLG-3 Optional format (from GRASS vector format).

.PP
Satellite imagery data are generally made available in an x,y coordinate
system.  In order to analyze imagery data in combination with other
GRASS data layers, it is necessary that all these data be rectified to
the same map coordinate system and projection.  Several GRASS programs
are used to rectify imagery data.

end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF

.NH 1
Interfaces between GRASS and other Software
.PP
One function usefully performed by GRASS is to output data in a form suitable
for input to other existing computer models.
GRASS programs allow GRASS data to be interfaced with those
of the
BNOISE (blast noise simulation),
X-Windows (X-Windows user interface),
MAPGEN (map generation functions for plotter output),
PPM (portable pix-map utilities),
ARMSED (watershed and sedimentation modeling),
ELAS (image processing), UW-RIM (University of Washington's version of the RIM
relational data base management system), the "S" statistical package,
and ISM (interactive surface modeling) programs.
The user can, of course, use GRASS programs to put data into a form suitable
for import and export to/from programs other than these.
.NH 1
Digitizing and Map Development
.PP
To be used by GRASS programs, data must be digitally stored in a GRASS data base.
Data can be entered into a GRASS data base in one of several ways.
(1)  Hardcopy data (like paper maps) may be either digitized or scanned
into GRASS's vector file format;
(2)  data already available in another digital format (like ARC-INFO data)
may be converted into GRASS's digital data file format,
and stored in a GRASS data base;
(3)  GRASS analysis programs can be used to create new GRASS data
from data already stored in GRASS digital data file format.
The GRASS programs listed below are designed for the input, manipulation,
and adjustment of data from sources outside of GRASS.
.NH 2
Digitizing Maps
.PP
These commands allow for the addition of paper (and other hardcopy geographic
information) into GRASS data bases, and for the manipulation of vector
data in GRASS.
EOF

end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
Editing and Patching Map Data
.PP
Frequently, (due to the size of digitizing tablets) users digitize data
in relatively small chunks which must be "patched" together before
data are analyzed.
The GRASS commands listed below are used to edit and patch digital data.
EOF
foreach f (\
r.mapcalc\
r.patch\
v.patch\
v.prune\
v.spag\

end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
Creating Support Files for GRASS Maps
.PP
A variety of supporting information is needed for each GRASS "map layer".
For data stored in GRASS vector format, information on the location of vectors,
the file topology, vector category values, and category labels
are stored in separate files.  For data stored in GRASS raster format,
additional files are also stored to hold information on category colors,
the map's development history, etc.
The below programs help the user build necessary GRASS support files
for raster and vector data.
EOF
foreach f (\
r.support\
v.support\
)
echo .IP \"$f -\" 16 >> $OUTPUT
grep -v ^$ $f | sed -e '/^\\/s/^[^-]*- //' | sed -e '/^(GRASS/D' >> $OUTPUT
end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
Importing and Exporting Data to Other Data Formats
.PP
Often, data which one wishes to use in a GRASS data base are already
available in digital data formats other than GRASS.  Similarly, users
often wish to export data from GRASS into other software systems' data formats.
A number of GRASS programs are available to import and export data to and
from GRASS.  These are listed below.
EOF

r.in.ascii\
r.in.ll\

grep -v ^$ $f | sed -e '/^\\/s/^[^-]*- //' | sed -e '/^(GRASS/D' >> $OUTPUT
end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF

.NH 1
Image Processing
.PP
Remotely-sensed images, such as satellite data and aerial photographs, are widely
available in a digital format.  The data in these images can be interpreted using
image processing techniques that classify image elements based on the spectral
reflectance values of individual image pixels or on user-identified pixel groupings.
GRASS integrates GIS with image processing capabilities.  This allows image data
to augment a GRASS data base, and allows image classifications to be guided
by known elements in other maps in the GIS data base.
Processing of remotely-sensed imagery typically involves:
.LP
(1) extracting data from their magnetic storage media,
(2) entering extracted data into a GRASS data base,
(3) classifying pixels and elements in the image,
(4) rectifying the image to a map coordinate system and projection, and
(5) correcting and enhancing the image.
.LP
GRASS commands commonly used to perform image processing are listed below.
Because imagery are stored as raster data, the GRASS raster analysis functions
can be used to analyze imagery.  The paper \fIr.mapcalc:  An Algebra for
GIS and Image Processing\fR, describes ways in which \fIr.mapcalc\fR can be used
as an image processing tool.
.NH 2
Tape Extraction
.PP
Once imagery data are obtained from agencies, they must be extracted
from the magnetic tapes on which they are stored.  GRASS commands exist
to extract LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM), Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS),
and such other satellite imagery as SPOT data from half-inch magnetic tape.
Procedures for extracting this data from tape and importing it into
a GRASS data base are described in the \fIGRASS Imagery Tutorial\fR.

end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
File Management
.PP
Users can "group" imagery files for analysis purposes, and "target" imagery
files to the files in another GRASS location.  These are basic commands
for the management of imagery files.
EOF

i.group\
i.target\
)

end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
Image Classification
.PP
Image classification is the process of categorizing the data in a raster image
based on the spectral reflectance values of each map pixel (cell).
Classification can be done using unsupervised or supervised methods.
GRASS contains functions to conduct both kinds of classifications.
In a supervised classification, the user can define the categories into
which pixels are to be placed;  in an unsupervised classification,
the computer attempts to categorize pixels in a user-defined number
of attempts based on statistical regularities in the data.

.NH 2
Geometric Rectification
.PP
Imagery data are generally made available in an x,y coordinate system.
In order to analyze imagery data in combination with other GRASS data layers,
it is necessary that all these data be rectified to the same coordinate system
and map projection.  Several GRASS programs are used to rectify imagery data.

.NH 2
Image Correction
.PP
Commonly, when analyzing multiple images, it is necessary to correct image
distortions attributable to such sources as the earth's radiation.  Such
distortions can result in different spectral reflectance values being collected
for the same image pixel, based on the time of day, month, year, etc., at which
the image was photographed.  GRASS programs exist which help the user to identify
and eliminate such distortions from images, allowing valid comparisons to made among
images.  See the paper \fIr.mapcalc:  An Algebra for GIS and Image Processing\fR
for an example of how radiometric corrections can be made to an image.

.NH 2
Building Custom Filters
.PP
The user may wish to model interactions across a landscape, or to
remove systematic distortions occurring across a map or image.
Both applications can be approached by filtering data.
The user can build custom filters to make the value of one pixel
a (user-defined) function of the values in the surrounding cells.
The paper \fIr.mapcalc:  An Algebra for GIS and Image Processing\fR
provides examples of how some spatial filters commonly used in image processing
can be built using \fIr.mapcalc\fR.  See also the section below on

.NH 1
Analyzing Data in GRASS
.PP
GRASS was designed as an image processing and map analysis system.
Most GRASS analysis programs operate on raster data;  \fIs.db.rim\fR operates
on site data.
GRASS programs exist that allow the user to convert GRASS data between
raster, vector, and site formats.
GRASS data analysis functions can be employed for such tasks as:
(1) general data manipulation,
(2) site data analysis,
(3) two- and three-dimensional manipulations,
(4) single cell map reporting functions,
(5) multi-cell coincidence tabulations and comparisons,
(6) neighborhood analysis and filtering,
(7) regional analysis and filtering,
(8) proximity analysis,
(9) Boolean overly functions, and
(10) terrain analysis functions.

Neighborhood Analysis/Filters
.PP
The user may wish to model interactions across a landscape, or to
remove systematic distortions occurring across a map or image.
The user may also wish to eliminate "noise" from map data in order to make
the basic results more visually apparent.
Such applications can be approached by filtering data.
The user can build custom filters to make the value of one pixel
a (user-defined) function of the values in the surrounding cells.
The paper \fIr.mapcalc:  An Algebra for GIS and Image Processing\fR

Regional Analysis/Filters
.PP
GRASS can also be used to analyze and filter data "regions".  Neighborhood
filters modify each cell value as a function of the cell values found in
its (square) neighborhood.
Regional filters make each cell value a function of the values found
within its (user-defined) region/clump of cells.  A region can be defined as
a contiguous group of cells having the same category value.
Such filters are useful for imagery analysis and other applications.

Proximity Analysis
.PP
GRASS can be used to examine the proximity of certain map categories from
others.  Often, this is useful when determining which geographic areas
warrant further analysis.  For example, if investigating potential nesting
sites of species X, the user might restrict his analysis to areas within
a 300-meter radius of cells containing relevant species habitat.

Boolean Overlay Functions
.PP
GRASS can perform basic Boolean overlay functions,
involving data union ("or" operations), intersection ("and" operations),
and exclusion ("not" operations).  The GRASS commands listed below are
used to do this.
EOF

r.combine\
r.cross\

Terrain Analysis
.PP
Elevation data are crucial to any GIS.  A number of GRASS commands were
designed specifically to address terrain analysis issues related to
water movement, development of ballistic trajectories,
and computation of slope and aspect.
Although the GRASS commands listed below were designed to analyze terrain data,
they in fact can be used to analyze any data types.
See also \fId.3d\fR, \fIr.mapcalc\fR, \fIr.clump\fR,
and the paper \fIr.mapcalc:  An Algebra for GIS and Image Processing\fR.

.NH 1
Map Display
.PP
GRASS includes a full range of functions for display of GRASS outputs
on the user's graphics device.  These commands manage the graphics display
device (monitor), manage the display frames to which output is sent,
report on the contents of the images displayed to the monitor,
and are used for map design, display, input and screen capture.
.NH 2
Management of Graphics Display Monitor
.PP
GRASS supports the use of multiple graphics display monitors during a GRASS
session.  The \fId.mon\fR command is used to start, select, stop, and unlock
graphics monitors for GRASS display output.
EOF
foreach f (\
d.mon\
)
echo .IP \"$f -\" 16 >> $OUTPUT
grep -v ^$ $f | sed -e '/^\\/s/^[^-]*- //' | sed -e '/^(GRASS/D' >> $OUTPUT
end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
Management of Display Frames on the Graphics Display Monitor
.PP
After the user has started and selected a graphics monitor for output,
the user can subdivide the monitor into different "frames", and display
different GRASS outputs in each frame.  For example, the GRASS program
\fIi.points\fR divides the monitor into multiple frames to allow the user
to target rectification points on an image to (user-known) points on another
map layer.  Similarly, the GRASS macro \fI3d.view.sh\fR divides the monitor
into nine frames to demonstrate the 3-d viewing function of GRASS.
EOF
foreach f (\
d.erase\
d.frame\
)
echo .IP \"$f -\" 16 >> $OUTPUT
grep -v ^$ $f | sed -e '/^\\/s/^[^-]*- //' | sed -e '/^(GRASS/D' >> $OUTPUT
end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
Map Display Reporting Functions
.PP
Several GRASS commands enable the user to query the contents of raster
map layers displayed in the active frame on the user's graphics monitor.
EOF

d.measure\
d.what.rast\
d.what.vect\
d.where\

end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
Map Design, Display, Input and Capture
.PP
Numerous GRASS commands enable the user to develop, display, and capture
raster, vector, site, textual, and symbol/icon data to the graphics display
monitor.  Similar functions are available for hardcopy map design and output
(see "Printing Maps", below).

.NH 1
Printing Maps
.PP
The map printing process parallels that for map display.  Typically, however,
printing of outputs is done only after all map analysis is complete.
The user should design a map's contents, select a paint device (printer)
to which output will be sent, and then print the map.
.NH 2
Designing Maps for Printed Output
.PP
A full range of map design functions, similar to those available for
map display, are accessed through the GRASS commands listed below.
EOF
foreach f (\
p.chart\
p.colors\
p.icons\
p.labels\
p.map\
)
echo .IP \"$f -\" 16 >> $OUTPUT
grep -v ^$ $f | sed -e '/^\\/s/^[^-]*- //' | sed -e '/^(GRASS/D' >> $OUTPUT
end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
Choosing a Printer for Hardcopy Output
.PP
A user may have several printers (and display devices) connected
to a GRASS system.  Before printing a map, the user must first select
which device will be used to print output produced by the GRASS paint/print
commands.  In GRASS, the \fIp.select\fR command is used to select a
device for paint/print output.  The \fIGRASS Hardware Configuration Guide\fR
lists painters/printers to which GRASS paint/print output can be sent.
In addition to hardcopy output devices (printers), a "preview" driver also
exists to send paint output to a user's graphics display monitor.
User sites can also elect to write new device drivers.
The \fIGRASS Programmer's Manual\fR and the \fIGRASS Installation Guide\fR
discuss some of the requirements of device drivers.
EOF
foreach f (\
p.select\
)
echo .IP \"$f -\" 16 >> $OUTPUT
grep -v ^$ $f | sed -e '/^\\/s/^[^-]*- //' | sed -e '/^(GRASS/D' >> $OUTPUT
end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF
.NH 2
Printing Hardcopy Map Output
.PP
The below commands exist to print the output produced by GRASS
\fIpaint\fR commands.
EOF
foreach f (\
p.map\
p.screen\
)
echo .IP \"$f -\" 16 >> $OUTPUT
grep -v ^$ $f | sed -e '/^\\/s/^[^-]*- //' | sed -e '/^(GRASS/D' >> $OUTPUT
end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF

.NH 1
Report Generation
.PP
Several commands exist in GRASS to report information about a map's
contents, or the results of an analysis on one or more maps,
back to the user.  The user can also develop macros specific to his needs
to prepare other types of reports (see section entitled "Macro Development,"
and past issues of the newsletter \fIGRASSClippings\fR).
.NH 2
Reports on Contents of Single or Multiple Maps
.PP
The following GRASS commands report on the contents of one or more maps.
EOF

end
cat >> $OUTPUT << EOF

.NH 1
Macro Development
.PP
GRASS has often been referred to as a "tool chest" of commands.
In this scenario, the user supplies the data and the notion
of which functions to perform (i.e., a model), while
GRASS supplies the commands (functions) necessary to run the model.
.NH 2
Programming Tools
.PP
The below commands are actually UNIX shell scripts running a series
of GRASS commands.  They exist both to perform a specific function
and to exhibit how such macros can be constructed.
All are stored under the directory \fI$GISBASE/scripts\fR.
It is hoped that user sites will develop their own macros based on these
examples.
