i.points -

i.points enables the user to mark coordinate system points on an
@glossary("image",16.glossary/img.def) to be rectified and then input the coordinates of each point
for calculation of a transformation matrix.  i.points must be followed
by @man("i.rectify") which rectifies the image using the transformation
matrix coefficients calculated in i.points.  @man("i.target") must be run
before i.points to enable the 'plot cell' option to be used and to
identify the database LOCATION in which the rectified image will be
deposited following i.rectify.
