v.in.dxf - 

v.in.dxf generates GRASS "dig_ascii" and "dig_att" layers from a DXF
formatted file.  Each layer in the DXF file is converted to a separate
"dig_ascii" layer.  For each DXF layer containing text, a "dig_att"
file is also generated.  These output files are placed in the GRASS
"dig_ascii" and "dig_att" directories.  The v.in.dxf will only
recognize points, lines, polylines and text in the DXF format and will
translate these to the GRASS vector format; other types of data are
ignored.
