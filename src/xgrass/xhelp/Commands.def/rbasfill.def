r.basins.fill - 

r.basins.fill generates a @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) map layer depicting subbasins, based
on input raster map layers for the coded stream network (where each
channel segment has been "coded" with a unique @glossary("category value",16.glossary/catval.def) and
for the ridges within a given watershed.  The raster map layer
depicting ridges should include the ridge which defines the perimeter of
the watershed.  The coded stream network can be generated as part of
the @man("r.watershed") program, but the map layer of ridges will need to be
created by digitizing using the @man("v.digit") program.
