i.cca - 

i.cca is an image processing program that takes from two to eight
@glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) @glossary("band files",16.glossary/bandfil.def) and a signature file and outputs the same
number of band files transformed to provide maximum separability of
the categories indicated by the signatures.

Typically, the user will use the i.class program to collect a set
of signatures and pass those signatures along with the band files
to i.cca.
