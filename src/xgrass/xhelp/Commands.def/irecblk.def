i.rectify.blk - 

i.rectify.blk allows the user to ortho-rectify an imagery group 
file.  An imagery photo block consists of several @glossary("scanned",16.glossary/scan.def) aerial
photographs (@glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) files) of a common area.  An imagery sub-
block is a subset of these raster files.  Block and sub-blocks of
imagery groups are created by the GRASS imagery program @man("i.build.blk").
i.rectify.blk guides the user through the steps required to ortho-
rectify a single sub-block of imagery groups contained in a block.
