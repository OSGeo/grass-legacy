i.cluster - 

i.cluster is an imagery program which generates spectral
signatures for the land cover types in an image using a clustering
algorithm.  The cluster spectral signatures that result are composed
of cluster means and covariance matrices.  These matrices are then
used in the second pass program i.maxlik to classify the image.
