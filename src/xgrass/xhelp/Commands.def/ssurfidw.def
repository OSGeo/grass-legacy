s.surf.idw - 

s.surf.idw fills a @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) matrix with interpolated values generated
from a set of irregularly spaced data points using numerical
approximation (weighted averaging) techniques.  In comparison with
other methods, numerical approximation allows representation of more
complex surfaces, restricts the spatial influence of any errors and
generates the interpolated surface from the data points.  s.surf.idw
allows the user to use a GRASS site list file, rather than a raster map
layer, as input.
