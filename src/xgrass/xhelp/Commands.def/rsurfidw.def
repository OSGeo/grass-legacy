r.surf.idw - 

r.surf.idw fills a raster matrix with interpolated values generated
from a set of irregularly spaced data points using numerical
approximation (weighted averaging) techniques.  The interpolated value
of a @glossary("cell",16.glossary/cell.def) is determined by values of nearby data points and the
distance of the cell from those input points.  In comparison with other
methods, numerial approximation allows representation of more complex
surfaces (particularly those with anomalous features), restricts the
spatial influence of any errors, and generates the interpolated surface
from the data points.  It is the most appropriate method to apply to
most spatial data.
