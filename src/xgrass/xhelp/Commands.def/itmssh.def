i.tape.mss.h

This program is an imagery function that extract header information
from LANDSAT Multispectral Scanner @glossary("(MSS)",16.glossary/mss.def) imagery stored on half
inch tape.  The header contains the center latitude and longitude
for the image and the number of rows and columns in the scene.  This
information may be of use in locating the portion of the MSS image
of interest, if the whole image is not required.  If you are not
familiar with MSS imagery, however, the header information format may
be difficult to understand.  This program is not required prior to
running 'i.tape.mss'.
