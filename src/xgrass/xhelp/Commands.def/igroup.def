i.group - 

i.group is an imagery program that allows the user to group any of
the raster imagery files that are present in the current @glossary("LOCATION",16.glossary/loc.def)
and currently selected @glossary("mapsets",16.glossary/mapset.def) into:

	1. a subgroup of the first group created during tape
         extraction;
	2. a new imagery group, and subsequently, a subgroup
         of a new imagery group;
	3. an already existing group in the current LOCATION and
         MAPSET, and subsequently, a subgroup of an already
         existing group.

i.group also allows the user to remove raster files from a group in
his or her MAPSET.  Raster files, however, cannot be removed from, or
added to existing subgroups.  If a new subgroup is needed, the 
procedure recommended is to create a new subgroup.

i.group is able to offer its options to all of the raster files in
the MAPSETS that were selected using the GRASS command @man("g.mapsets").
i.group, however, is restricted to the files and selected MAPSETS in
the current LOCATION.  The raster files available to i.group, then,
will include all raster files that result from analyses using GRASS,
e.g., classified images, color composites, contrast streches, 
neighborhood filters, results of @man("r.mapcalc"), @man("r.buffer"), etc.
