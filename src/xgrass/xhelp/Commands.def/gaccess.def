g.access - 

g.access allows the user to control access to the current @glossary("mapset",16.glossary/mapset.def).
Normally, any user can read data from any GRASS mapset.  But sometimes
it is desirable to prohibit access to certain sensitive data.  The
g.access command allows a user to restrict read and execute access to
the current mapset.  It will not modify write access to the current
mapset.
