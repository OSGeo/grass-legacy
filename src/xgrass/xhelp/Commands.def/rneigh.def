r.neighbors - 

r.neighbors looks at each @glossary("cell",16.glossary/cell.def) in a @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) input file and examines
the @glossary("category values",16.glossary/catval.def) assigned to the cells in some user-defined
"neighborhood" around it.  It ouputs a new raster map layer in which
each cell is assigned a category value that is some (user-specified)
function of the values in that cell's neighborhood.
