                 RELEASING AND UNLOCKING A MONITOR    

Once a user has selected a monitor for graphics output, it is locked
for use by that user until either:  (1) the user voluntarily releases
control of the monitor for use by another, or (2) another GRASS user
unlocks the user's control of the monitor.  Only the user who has
selected a monitor for output can release control of it.  However,
other users can achieve the same effect by running @man("d.mon") from the
command line and unlocking another user's control of a monitor.
