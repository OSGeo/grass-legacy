       MOVING DATA TO ANOTHER COMPUTER (ASCII/BINARY CONVERSION)

One form of data conversion is the conversion of data in ASCII format
to and from binary format.  American Standard Code for Information
Interchange (ASCII) is a "standard seven-bit character code by which
information is stored and transmitted in a computer or a data
transmission system" (OED).  The 128 characters in the ASCII character
set are produced by combinations of the shift and control keys with the
other keys.  All its characters are of a fixed, seven-bit length.  Files
in ASCII format can be read by the user.

In binary format, data are represented as a series of 0's and 1's.  A
binary digit (0 or 1) is called a "bit" of information.  Files are put
in binary format to put them in a code that the computer can understand.
Binary format is machine-readable.  Typically, users cannot read files
in binary format.

The commands listed below are useful to those importing and exporting
data to and from GRASS and when converting data among various file
formats.  They perform ASCII/binary data conversions.

Commands with the extension ".in.ascii" produce binary files from ASCII
input.  Commands with the ".out.ascii" extension produce ASCII output
from binary input.

Commands with the ".in.dlg" extension produce GRASS vector format from
DLG-3 Optional format input.  Commands with the "out.dlg" extension
produce DLG-3 Optional format output from GRASS vector format input.
