i.group

i.group is an imagery program that allows the user to group any
of the raster imagery files that are present in the current
@glossary("location",16.glossary/loc.def) and currently selected mapset into:

	1.  a subgroup of the first group created during
	    the tape extraction,

	2.  a new imagery group, and subsequently, a subgroup
	    of a new imagery group,

	3.  an already existing group in the current location
	    and mapset, and subsequently, a subgroup of an
	    already existing group.

i.group also allows the user to remove raster imagery files from
a group in his or her mapset.  Raster files, however, cannot be
removed from, or added to, existing subgroups.  If a new subgroup
is needed, the procedure recommended is to create a new subgroup.

i.group is able to offer its options to all of the raster imagery
files in the mapsets that were selected using the GRASS command
@man("g.mapsets").  i.group, however, is restricted to the files and
selected mapsets in the user's current GRASS location.
