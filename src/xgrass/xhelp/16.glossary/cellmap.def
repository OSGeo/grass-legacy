cell map - The set of digital GRASS data and support files
associated with each raster data file, describing a defined
geographic region.  This set includes a @glossary("raster file",16.glossary/rastfile.def), @glossary("category",16.glossary/cat.def)
file, color table files, etc.

NOTE: "Cell map" was the term used to denote maps in raster format
in previous versions of GRASS.  A "cell map" is now referred to as
a "raster map" in GRASS 4.0 documentation.
