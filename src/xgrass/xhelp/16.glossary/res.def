resolution - The smallest spacing between display elements; the
smallest size of a feature that can be mapped or sampled.  In GRASS,
because grid cells can be rectangular, resolution in the x direction
may differ from that in the y direction.  Fine resolution implies
large map @glossary("scale",16.glossary/scale.def).
