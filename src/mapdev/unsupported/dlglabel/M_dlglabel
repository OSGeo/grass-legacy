.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.I dlglabel
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I dlglabel
is the third phase of the
.I MAPDEV
system for converting a hard copy map to a
.I GRASS
grid cell map.
.I dlglabel
allows the user to label linear and areal features on dlg-3 maps.  'Label'
meaning give attribute/ category numbers to the features.
The category numbers are later used by 
.I GRASS
to give cell files category information.  The program is highly interactive
and the use of a graphics monitor is required.
.SH "FEATURES"
Simiplified method  of labeling and re-labeling.
Labeling is accomplished by the user entering a category number and then using
the mouse to label either areal or linear features.  Area and line category
numbers are maintened by the program and the user need not concern themselves
with them.
Re-labeling is just a matter of following the same procedure as labeling.
Any feature of the  map can be re-labeled as many times as needed.
.sp
Label displaying.  Each areal feature has a centroid associated with it that
can be displayed at anytime.
After an area is labeled, the point identified by the graphics cursor becomes
the new 'centroid' as well as the origin for placement of labels.
Area labels (category numbers) can also be displayed at
anytime and unlabeled areas become apparent by the fact that a centroid still
exists.  Linear features that have been labeled are highlighted.
.sp
Multiple session labeling.  Labeling can be completed in one session of
.I dlglabel
or can be completed in as many sessions as a person feels comfortable with.
.sp
Error reporting.  Any errors or discrepancies in the
.I dlg-3
file are noted and a printable report is created.
.sp
Windowing on the monitor.  It is possible to window in on a section of the
map displayed on the graphics monitor.  Color coding is used to distinguish
map information on the monitor in the following manner:

Two screen labeling.  Textual information is provided on an ascii terminal
screen freeing the entire graphics monitor for displaying the map.
