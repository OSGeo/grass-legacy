/* 1998-OCT-06 change from Benjamin Horner-Johnson <ben@earth.nwu.edu> */
	Changed dxf_line[80] to dxf_line[256] when I found 250 char label in
one of my DXF files <dxf2vect.h>.
	Changed label[80] to label[256], and buf[100] to buf[256] <label_box.c>.
	Changed layername[80] to layername[256] <add_polyline.c>
	Changed "80" to "256" in the dxf_fgets calls.

	modified: dxf2vect.h, add_arc.c, add_circle.c, add_line.c,
		  add_polyline.c, entities.c, find_lines.c, header.c,
		  label_box.c

/* 1998-OCT-01 change from Benjamin Horner-Johnson <ben@earth.nwu.edu> */
	Changed label from int to char (my character labels weren't coming
through from my DXF files), changed other things to support single digit/char
labels (char_cnt).
	modified: label_box.c

/* 1998-SEP-30 change from Benjamin Horner-Johnson <ben@earth.nwu.edu> */
	Added flag "-n" to allow suppression of text boxes
	modified: dxf2vect.h, main.c, label_box.c

Problem:
In file included from add_bounds.c:5:
dxf2vect.h:53: 'basename' redeclared as different kind of symbol
/usr/include/string.h:245: previous declaration of Basename'
make: *** [OBJ.linux/add_bounds.o] Error 1

My Solution':

I changed 'basename' into 'base_name' in:
        add_bounds.c
        add_extents.c
        dxf2vect.h
        main.c
        open_layer.c
        reopen_layer.c


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I fextension names are long, keep in mind the GRASS limit of 14 characters
for filenames.  To minimize the possibility of creating two output files
of the same name use the prefix option to abreviate the dxf file name
leaving the majority of characters available for differentiating between
layer names.

Making the dxf output directly to a vector binary file with the 
optional flag -a to output to an ascii file available on the commandline.

The v.in.dxf is now set to be tested.  To select a dxf file: (map=dxf_file)
1.  give full or relative pathname for the dxf_file
2.  be in the directory where dxf file is
