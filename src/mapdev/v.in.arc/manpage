.SH SYNOPSIS
.B v.in.arc 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I arc.to.grass 
will import ARC/INFO Generate format vector              
files to the GRASS vector format. 

.SH USER PROMPTS
The 
.I v.in.arc
program will prompt you to enter the names of
ARC/INFO files to be imported to GRASS.  ARC/INFO vector files to be
imported into GRASS must be exported from ARC/INFO using the ARC/INFO
Ungenerate command.   

ARC/INFO vector files which are to are to be imported to GRASS,
must be either line or polygon coverages.  The section of the ARC/INFO
manual that cover the Ungenerate command describes how to export line 
and polygon coverages.  

A polygon coverage is represented by three files: 1) a lines file,
which contains coordiates of all the area edge lines; 2) label-point
file, which contains coordintes of label-points each with a unique
label-point ID number.  There is one label-point for each polygon
defined in the lines file; 3) a label-text file, which associates
label-point ID number with a category number and attribute text.
 
A line coverage is represented by two files: 1) a lines file, which
contains coordiates of of the lines, each with a line-ID number; and
2) a label-text file, which associates each line-ID number with
a category number and attribute text.

See the "DATA FILE FORMATS" section for more information on lines files,
label-points files, and label-text files.
 
The 
.I v.in.arc
program will start out by asking the you which
type of coverage is to be imported, as follows:
 
.nf
      COVERAGE TYPE
     Enter "polygon" or "line"
     Hit RETURN to cancel request
     >
.fi

IMPORTING A POLYGON COVERAGE

First, we will go over the prompts that will be presented for coverage
type "polygon."  First, you will be asked if you want a neat-line: 

.nf
      NEATLINE
     Do you want a neatline ?
     Enter "yes" or "no"
     > 
.fi

If you answer yes then vectors representing a box around the data
will be inserted into the resulting GRASS vector file, otherwise no neatline
will be created.

Now, program 
.I v.in.arc
will prompt for the name of 
the lines-file containing the arc coodinates of the polygons.  The
lines-file is created with the Ungenerate LINES option and is the
same format as the prefix.pol file created by the 
.I v.out.arc
program.  The following is the prompt: 

.nf
      LINES FILENAME
     Enter name of the file created with the LINES 
     option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
     Hit RETURN to cancel request
     >
.fi

The next prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the
name of the label-points file.  The label-points files is created
with the Ungenerate POINTS option and is the same format as the
prefix.lab file created by the 
.I v.out.arc
program.  The
following is the prompt:

.nf
      LABEL-POINTS FILENAME
     Enter name of file created with the POINTS 
     option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command. 
     Hit RETURN if there is no such file 
     >
.fi

The last prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the name of the
label-text file.  This file associates each label-point ID number
with a text string and is the same format as the prefix.txt file
created by the 
.I v.out.arc
program.  The following is the prompt: 

.nf
      LABEL-TEXT FILENAME
     Enter the name of a file that associates
     label-point ID numbers with text label strings
     Hit RETURN if there is no such file
     > 
.fi

.I v.in.arc
will then scan the label-text file to determine how many columns are
in the file and to determine which column should be used as the 
label-point ID number column.  


.I v.in.arc
will then tell you how many lines and columns are in the label-text 
file.  Next
.I v.in.arc
will prompt you to enter the number of the column to be used for
GRASS category values.  The category number column MUST contain only 
integers.

.nf
     Enter the number of the column that is to be used
     for GRASS category values:
.fi

and the number the column to be used for GRASS attribute text.  The 
attribute text column can contain a floating point number, an integer, 
or a word.

.nf
     Enter the number of the column that should be used as
     for GRASS attribute text: 
.fi

Once you enter the category and attribute column numbers, 
.I v.in.arc
will begin conversion of the ARC/INFO generate files into GRASS vector format.

IMPORTING A LINE COVERAGE

Now, we will go over the prompts that are presented to you 
when you choose coverage type "lines."  First, you are 
prompted for the name of the lines-file containing the arc
coordinates of the lines.  The lines-file is created with the
Ungenerate LINES option and is the same format as the prefix.lin
file created by the 
.I v.out.arc
program. 

.nf
      LINES FILENAME
     Enter name of the file created with the lines
     option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
     Hit RETURN to cancel request
     >
.fi

The last prompt for coverage type "line" asks for the name of the
label-text file.  This file associates each line-ID number
with a text string and is the same format as the prefix.txt file
created by the 
.I v.out.arc
 program.  The following is the prompt: 

.nf
      LABEL-TEXT FILENAMES
     Enter name of file associating line ID numbers 
     numbers with label text. 
     Hit RETURN if there is no such file 
     >
.fi

.I arc.to.grass
will scan the label-text file to determine how many columns are
in the file and 
.I arc.to.grass
will then tell yu how many columns are in the label-text.  Next
.I arc.to.grass
will prompt you to enter the number of the column to be used 
for line-ID numbers. 

.nf
     Enter the number of the column that is to be used
     for line-ID numbers:
.fi

Next
.I arc.to.grass
will prompt the you enter the number of the column to be used for
GRASS category values.  The category number column MUST contain only 
integers.

.nf
     Enter the number of the column that is to be used
     for GRASS category values:
.fi

and the number of the column to be used for GRASS attribute text.  The 
attribute text column can contain a floating point number, an integer, 
or a word.

.nf
     Enter the number of the column that should be used as
     for GRASS attribute text: 
.fi


Once you enter the column numbers
.I arc.to.grass
will begin conversion of the ARC/INFO generate files into GRASS vector format.

.SH DATA FILE FORMATS
Following are examples of the data files discussed in the 
USERS PROMPTS section above.

LINES FILE, also known as prefix.lin or prefix.pol file.  This type of file
can be created in ARC/INFO by using the lines subcommand of the Ungenerate
command.   Each line, or arc, is defined by a line-ID number, followed by 
a list of at least two easting and northing coordinate pairs, followed by
a line with the word "END".  The file is terminated with the word "END".

The line-ID number is only important for line coverages.  For a line 
coverage, the line-ID number is the number that associates each line with
its attribute data.

LABEL-POINTS FILE, also known as prefix.lab file.  This type of file can be
created created in ARC/INFO by using the Points subcommand of the Ungenerate
command.  The first number on each line is a label-point ID number, the 
following two are easting northing coordinates for the label-point.

.SH NOTES
When importing a polygon coverage
.I arc.to.grass finds the label-point ID in a label-text file by
looking for the second column in the file that contains a "1" on line 1,
and a "2" on line 2.

If you are missing a label-points or a label-text file you can still
import ARC/INFO data (but none of your lines or areas will be labelled).
