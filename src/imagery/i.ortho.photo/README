These problems should replace the old ortho-rectification programs
(including i.build.block, i.rectify.block, i.camera, and i.mod.camera)

The main program is i.ortho.rectify which is just a menu driver for the 
following programs:
        ortho.select_target
        ortho.select_camera
        ortho.select_elevation
        ortho.image_to_photo
        ortho.photo_to_target
        ortho.initialize_exposure
        ortho.image_rectify



The following directories contain the source code:

	menu		-	main menu code
	select_target	-	select target location and mapset
	select_elevation-	select elevation model 
	select_camera	-	select a camera to use for parameters
	image_to_photo		-	code for image to photo coordinate
				-	transformation
	initial_exposure	-	choose initial camera exposure station 
				-	parameters
	photo_to_target		-	computes photo to target location
				-	transformation paramters
	image_rectify		-	does the actual image rectification	

        libes		-	libraries for ortho programs	
        man 		-       manual pages.
