.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIr.random.surface\fR generates a spatially dependent random surface. The 
random surface is composed of values representing the deviation from the mean
of the initial random values driving the algorithm. The initial random values
are independent Gaussian random deviates with a mean of 0 and standard 
deviation of 1. The initial values are spread over each \fIoutput\fR map using
filter(s) of diameter \fIdistance\fR. The influence of each random 
value on nearby cells is determined by a distance decay function based on
\fIexponent\fR. If multiple filters are passed over the output maps, each
filter is given a weight based on the \fIweight\fR inputs. 
The resulting random surface can have "any" mean and variance,
but the theoretical mean of an infinitely large map is \fI0.0\fR and a 
variance of \fI1.0\fR.  
Description of the algorithm is in the \fBNOTES\fR section.
.LP
Correlograms of an infinitely large map for a
particular set of \fIdistance\fR, \fIexponent\fR, and \fIweight\fR values
can be saved as a two dimensional correlogram if the \fI2Dcorrelogram\fR
option is chosen.  Correlograms for actual surfaces can be generated using
\fIr.1Dcorrelogram\fR and \fIr.2Dcorrelogram\fR.
.LP
The random surface generated are composed of floating point numbers, and
saved in the category description files of the output map(s).  
Cell values are uniformly or normally distributed between \fBlow\fR and 
\fBhigh\fR values inclusive (determined by whether the \fI-u\fR flag is 
used). The category names indicate the average floating 
point value and the range of floating point values that each cell value
represents.
.LP
\fBr.random.surface\fR's original goal is to generate random fields for use
in spatial error modeling.
A procedure to use \fBr.random.surface\fR in spatial error modeling is given
in the \fBNOTES\fR section.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fI-q\fR
This flag prevents the program from sending information to standard output.
.IP \fI-u\fR
This flag will make the \fIoutput\fR map's cell values have a uniform
distribution instead of a normal distribution.  Uniform distributions are
useful in situations where the user wants random values for a range of
integer values.  The user then uses the cell values instead of the random
values in the category description file.  The uniform flag is also useful
when the random values near the mean are more meaningful to the user.
The flag on will cause the cell values from 1 
to \fIhigh\fR to have an equal
chance of being used.  Thus, not using the flag is useful in situations where
you want to use the floating
point numbers in the category description in your analysis. 
Keeping this flag off will allow
the outliers of the random distribution to be more accurately represented. 
See the \fBNOTES\fR section for example use of this flag.
.IP \fIoutput\fR
Optional output map(s): Random surface(s). The cell values are a random 
distribution
between 1 and \fBhigh\fR values inclusive. The category values of
the \fIoutput\fR map(s) are in the form "#.# #.# to #.#" where each #.# is a 
floating point number. The first number is the average of the random values
the cell value represents. The other two numbers are the range of
random values for that cell value. The "average" mean value of generated
\fIoutput\fR map(s) is 0. The "average" variance of map(s) generated is 1.
The random values represent the standard deviation from the mean of that
random surface.
.IP \fI2Dcorrelogram\fR
Optional output map name: Two dimensional correlogram of an infinitely large 
random surface
created by the \fRdistance\fR, \fIexponent\fR, and \fIweight\fR parameters.
The correlogram is saved as a GRASS map using the current region.  The NW
corner of the map represents the correlation of a cell to itself (always 1.0).
The other cells of the \fI2Dcorrelogram\fR represent the "lag offset".  Thus,
a cell 1000 meters South and 2000 meters East of the NW corner represents
the correlation of cells 1000 meters North or South of each other and 2000
meters East or West of each other.  Correlation values will vary between 0.0
and 1.0 in this map (represented as values 0 through 100 until GRASS goes
floating point).  If the program \fBr.2Dcorrelogram\fR is used on a map, it's
range of values will be from -1.0 to 1.0 (or -100 through 100 in cell values)
because REAL maps can have negative correlation while an infinitely large
random field will not.
.IP \fIlags\fR
Optional input values(s)
.IP \fIdistance\fR
Input value(s) [default 0.0]: \fIdistance\fR determines the spatial dependence
of the \fIoutput\fR map(s). The \fIdistance\fR value indicates the minimum 
distance at which two map cells have no relationship to each other.
A \fIdistance\fR value of 0.0 indicates that there is no spatial
dependence (i.e., adjacent cell values have no relationship to each other). 
As the \fIdistance\fR value increases, adjacent cell values will have values
closer to each other. But the range and distribution of cell values over the
\fIoutput\fR map(s) will remain the same.  Visually, the clumps of lower and
higher values gets larger as \fIdistance\fR increases. If multiple values are 
given, each \fIoutput\fR map will have multiple filters, one for each 
set of \fIdistance\fR, \fIexponent\fR, and \fIweight\fR values.
.IP \fIexponent\fR
Input value(s) [default 1.0]: \fIexponent\fR determines the distance decay
exponent for a particular filter.  
The \fIexponent\fR value(s) have the property of determining the
"texture" of the random surface.  Texture will decrease as the 
\fIexponent\fR value(s) get closer to \fI1.0\fR.  Normally, \fIexponent\fR
will be \fI1.0\fR or greater.  As the \fIexponent\fR approaches \fI0.0\fR, the
random surface will have cliff-like properties in the output.
If there are no \fIexponent\fR values
given,  each filter will be given a \fIexponent\fR value of \fI1.0\fR.
If there is at least one \fIexponent\fR
value given, there must be one \fIexponent\fR value for each \fIdistance\fR
value.  
.IP \fIweight\fR
Input value(s) [default 1.0]: \fIweight\fR determines the relative importance
of each filter. For example, if there were two filters driving the algorithm
and \fBweight=1.0,2.0\fR was given in the command line: The second filter 
would be twice as important as the first filter.  
If no \fIweight\fR values
are given, each filter will be just as important as the other filters 
defining the random field.  If \fIweight\fR values exist, there must be 
a \fIweight\fR value for each filter of the random field.
.IP \fIhigh\fR
Input value [default 255]: Specifies the high end of the range of cell values
in the \fIoutput\fR map(s).  Specifying a very large \fIhigh\fR value will
minimize the "errors" caused by the random surface's discretization.  The
word errors is in quotes because errors in discretization are often going
to cancel each other out and the spatial statistics are far more sensitive
to the initial independent random deviates than any potential discretization
errors.
Input value(s) [default random]: Specifies the random seed(s), one for each
map, that \fBr.random.surface\fR will use to
generate the initial set of random values that the resulting map is
based on. If the random seed is not given, \fBr.random.surface\fR will get
a seed from the process ID number.
.SH NOTES
While most literature uses the term random field instead of random surface, 
this algorithm always generates a surface.  Thus, its use of random surface.
.LP
\fBr.random.surface\fR builds the random surface using a filter algorithm
smoothing a map of independent random deviates.  The size of the
filter is determined by the largest distance of spatial dependence.  The
shape of the filter is determined by the distance decay exponent(s), and
the various weights if different sets of spatial parameters are used.  The
map of independent random deviates will be as large as the current region 
PLUS the extents of the filter.  This will eliminate edge effects caused
by the reduction of degrees of freedom.
The map of independent random deviates will ignore the current mask for the
same reason.
.LP
One of the most important uses for \fBr.random.surface\fR is to determine how
the error inherent in raster maps might effect the analyses done with those
maps. 
If you wanted to check to
see how sensitive your analysis is to the errors in the DEMs in your 
study area, the following procedure could be used:
.LP
1) Collect elevation data at an accuracy and precision level that will not
effect the outcome of your application for sections of your study area.  Save
this as a raster map.  This data will be used as the "truth map", determining 
the spatial autocorrelation of the original elevation data.
.LP
2) Mask out areas without collected higher accuracy elevation data.
.LP
3) Generate an error map by subtracting the more accurate elevation data from 
the DEMs: 
.in +.2i
\fBr.mapcalc Error \*= 'DEM - CollectElevation'\fR
.in -.2i
.LP
4) Use \fIr.correlogram\fR and/or \fIr.2Dcorrelogram\fR to generate 
correlograms of the error map (the following program assumes a map resolution
of 100 meters): 
.in +.2i
\fBr.correlogram input\*=Error lag\*=100 lagfile\*=ErrorFile\fR
.in -.2i
.LP
5) Note that the standard output from \fIr.correlogram\fR gives the
variance of Error.  Look at the lagfile to determine the distance of spatial 
dependence (the
\fIdistance\fR parameter in \fIr.random.surface\fR).  The
distance parameter can be determined by looking where
the correlation drops to \fI0.0\fR.  This example assumes the distance
of spatial dependence is 8700 meters.
.LP
6) Experiment with \fIr.random.surface\fR by building theoretical 
correlograms until one is similar
to the error's correlogram.  For example:
.in +.2i
/fBr.random.surface dist\*=8700 exp\*=1.5\fR
.in -.2i
.LP
7) After you are satified with the quality of fit, generate a number of 
potential DEMs.  The following commands generates one potential DEM (this 
example assumes the 
variance of error is 7.5 meters):
.in +.2i
\fBr.random.surface out\*=NormalDistribution dist\*=8700 exp\=1.5\fR
\fBr.mapcalc PotentialDEM \*= 'DEM + @NormalDistribution * 7.5'\fR
.in -.2i
The use
of the '@' character makes \fIr.mapcalc\fR use the values in the category file 
instead of the cell values.
.LP
8) Run your application many times using different potential DEM maps instead 
of the actual DEM.
.LP
9) Compare the results of your potential analyses with each other.
Stochastically compare the results to determine the distribution of possible
results of the application.
If the results are different enough to modify the decisions
to be made because of the analysis: get more accurate data, improve the 
analysis, or cover your butt in case the decisions prove to be wrong.

coverage maps, see \fIr.random.model\fR.
