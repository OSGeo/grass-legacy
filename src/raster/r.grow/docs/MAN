.nf
grow
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Grow
generates an output layer from the input layer by
"growing" areas one pixel width.  The user is given the
option of making the output completely binary, regardless of
category values in the input layer.  Otherwise, cells
added through the process of growing will have
category value 1, and all other cells the original category
value of the input map layer.
.SH NOTES
Grow works properly with supercell layers.
The current window setting is ignored. Instead,
the window of the input map layer is used.
