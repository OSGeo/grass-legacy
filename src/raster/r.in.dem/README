This is r.in.dem, a program to convert DEM files to GRASS raster format.
In its current state, it is fully functional, and I consider it more or
less finished.

This version converts only from lat/lon to UTM, because those were the
only specs availible from the USGS DEM Web page. I think that it should
be fairly easy to modify it to support other projections.

I am not an experienced programmer, and would appreciate comments and
suggestions on the code. I place the code in the public domain. Please
let me know of any improvements made to it.

****** Notes ******* 

The program reads the DEM header and uses that as much as possible to
determine the size, resolution, etc. of the data. It makes some guesses
as to the resolution for output, outputting at slightly higher resolution
that the input to avoid data loss in rotation. These numbers can also be
specified on the command line.

To convert the data, the program breaks up the input grid into triangles
and for each one finds the output grid points that fall within it. It
interpolates the data to each point from the three corner points.

The output data is stored in a partially ordered tree, until the tree
fills up. Its size is #defined as PTREE_SIZE in bintree.h. The data is
then dumped to a cache, which writes to disk. The purpose of the cache 
is to consolidate consecutive writes into a few long ones.

All development was done on an SGI Indy, using SGI CC, gcc 2.7.2, and
the libraries from each compiler. The code is ANSI compliant, checked
with lint.
  
***** History  *******

1.1) Obviously bad data on the diagonal clued me in to some serious
problems in the interpolation algorithm. It has been redone, and now
works properly (and faster).

***** Yet to Fix *****
I found a no-data point in the output where there probably should be
data. Perhaps the point fell too close to a line. I'm not sure this
is a real problem, nor do I have a fix.

It might be worth it to add support for compressed input files. I don't
know how to do this, but it doesn't seem too complicated (pipe through
gzip, I assume).
