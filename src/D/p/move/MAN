.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Dmove
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dmove 
is an

moves a window containing mapped information on the screen to a new user chosen
screen location.

.SH LIMITATIONS
Since
.I Dsave
command does not catch input to such commands as 
.B "Dpoints, Dsites, and Dmapgraph",
the moved window may not be regenerated exactly.
Note that ONLY maps can be moved.  The programming for this utility is
incomplete.  Use of Dmove during demonstrations should be avoided.
