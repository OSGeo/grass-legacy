1. Introduction

   GRASS-JNI allows programmers to access GRASS data from their
   applications written in Java.  It uses JNI (Java Native Interface)
   calls to function in GRASS library and its API closely resembles
   GRASS Programmers' API.

   General information about GRASS can be found on 
     http://www.baylor.edu/~grass/

   General information about Java can be found on
     http://java.sun.com/

2. Obtaining

   You can download GRASS-JNI from RSI WWW-site:

3. Installing and use in your programs

   Unpack downloaded archive using one of the following commands

     Sources:
     gzip -dc grass-jni-0.7.4.src.tar.gz | tar -xf - 

     Solaris 2.5.1 (sparc) binaries: 
     gzip -dc grass-jni-0.7.4.sol251.tar.gz | tar -xf - 

   Then cd to grass-jni directory:

     cd grass-jni-0.7.4

   if you downloaded documentation then unpack it with the command:
     gzip -dc ../grass-jni-0.7.4.doc.tar.gz | tar -xf - 

   Then follow the instruction in the INSTALL file:

   Download gzip from http://www.gzip.org/ if it is missing on your
   system.

4. Current Release (0.7.4)

   Current series of releases is intended mainly for experienced GRASS
   programmers and does not constitute a finished product.  At the
   moment it lacks implementations of many functions in GRASS library
   and others (most write operations) have not been tested thoroughly.
   GRASS-JNI API is mostly stable but some changes are be expected in
   future versions.  Specifically interface for reading/writing of
   GRASS layers will be reworked.

   The main problem from Java standpoint is that the current release
   of GRASS-JNI is not thread-safe.  We will address these issues in
   future releases.

5. Design Overview

   GRASS-JNI is built in a way to make it easy for GRASS programmers
   to write in Java.  Most of its classes and methods have
   corresponding counterparts in GRASS API.  It does not provide an
   object-oriented abstraction in terms of GIS but rather it is a
   straightforward translation of C function in GRASS library to Java.
   
   The basic functions of GRASS GIS Library are accessible via
   corresponding methods in libgis class.  Instance of libgis class
   must be created first to use any methods or classes in GRASS-JNI.
   This will load all needed shared libraries.  With libgis you get
   access to the functions that report current library settings,
   region settings and (in future) projection information and perform
   calculations.  Also it serves as a factory of objects like the ones
   used for read/write operations on database files.  An instance of
   libvect class must be created to access functions from Vect
   library.

   Most of the data structure in GRASS Library have corresponding
   classes in GRASS-JNI.  These classes have a field that stores a
   memory pointer to the C struct.  In such cases, the class
   constructor calls a JNI method that allocates the struct using
   either malloc or function from GRASS API if it is available.  Then
   the allocated memory can be freed by either explicitly calling a
   designated method of the class or after a call to finalize() method
   before garbage collection.  Sometimes classes that wrap struct have
   additional functionality and perform checks to avoid core dumps.
   Particular fields can be accessed using [get]<Field>/set<Field>
   methods and toArray/fromArray methods if the field stores an array
   of values.

   Rasters, site lists and vector in GRASS database are accessed via
   wrapping classes for file descriptors, streams and struct Map_info.
   On creation these classes open files by calling relevant functions
   from the GRASS library.  The resource (open file) will be freed
   during garbage collection but it is recommended to explicitly call
   the method 'close' or similar since time of garbage collection is
   usually not predictable.
   
   Authors aimed at not disturbing of the operation of GRASS library
   functions.  No changes in GRASS sources or recompilation of GRASS
   library are required to make it work with GRASS-JNI.  Also we
   attempted to minimize the amount of reverse engineering of GRASS
   source code and relied only on documented features of GRASS API
   unless the opposite is stated in documentation for particular class
   or method.

   Naming conventions

     We tried to preserve the same names of function and structs as in
     GRASS API whenever it iss possible.  For example, function

       char *G_find_cell(char *name, char *mapset) 
     
     becomes a method in libgis class 

       String G_find_cell(String name, String mapset)

     However the names of classes that wrap GRASS API data structure
     have underscores ommitted.  It was done because translation of
     underscores in class names into the names of corresponding C
     files and function makes them difficult to read.

   Please note that the authors' original intention was not to develop
   a universal library to access GRASS function from java rather than
   to interface their own system to GRASS.  This can explain some
   peculiarities in GRASS-JNI design.
