For the libraries already in use by GRASS see the file REQUIREMENTS.


font libraries:
===============

freetype library (libttf)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
http://www.freetype.org 
FreeType engine 1.1, Version 2.0 beta8 
TrueType font rendering engine, some problems for U.S. am. users because of
Apple's patents.

pango:
~~~~~~
http://www.pango.org 
Library to render fonts in many different languages, very promising
approach, but currently only a prototype.

fnlib:
~~~~~~
http://www.tux.org/pub/X-Windows/enlightenment/fnlib
Color X font rendering library 
Version 0.5 (fnlib-0.5.tar.gz)
used in the Enlightenment Window Manager


graphic libraries:
==================

g2 graphical library:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
http://g2.sourceforge.net
easy to use, portable and powerful 2D graphics library. Following devices
are currently supported: PostScript, X11, GIF and Win32.
Written in C with additional fortran and perl interface.

gd graphical library:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
http://www.boutell.com/gd/
A graphics library for fast image creation (PNG, JPEG, WBMP, Xpm)
(no true-color support now, planned for v. 2.0)
8bit only

llib Image Library:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
http://www.radix.net/~cknudsen/Ilib/
can read, create, manipulate and save images in PPM, XPM, GIF, PNG and JPG
format.

Open GUI (Fast GL):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
http://www.tutok.sk/fastgl
FastGL is a fast, multi-platform 32-bit graphics library ...
(obviously only for x86-processors, uses assembler!)

imlib and imlib2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
http://www.us.rasterman.com/imlib.html
Image loading, rendering and saving library, uses existing libraries for
different image formats. Could be used for a multi-format import module in
GRASS.

gdk-pixbuf:
~~~~~~~~~~~
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gdk-pixbuf/
Image handling libray (something concurrent to imlib)
Version 0.8.0
GDK with GdkRGB (layer of abstraction between GTK+ and windowing system)

libungif:
~~~~~~~~~
http://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/~badger/software/libungif
http://www.rge.com/pub/multimedia/libungif/
Allows the reading and writing of GIF images avoiding the infamous Unisys
LZW patent Could be used to make a r.in.gif/r.out.gif without copyright
infringement of the Unisys patent (and of course without compression/the
ability to read compressed gifs!). Version 4.1.0

libart:
~~~~~~~
http://www.levien.com/libart/
http://www.artofcode.com/libart.html
A general image library that allows to render high quality maps, fonts etc.
Could be used to implement a multi-layered map generator.


computational geometry, geometry libraries:
===========================================

detri:
~~~~~~
http://www.geocities.com/mucke/GeomDir/detri.html

gts:
~~~~
http://gts.sourceforge.net

dewall:
~~~~~~~
