Before fixing this problem.  Should we consider maybe eliminating it?
The only programs it really serves a purpose for are shell scripts and
compiled programs that have not yet implemented a G_parser() interface.

I would suggest we consider just putting the executables in grass5/bin
directly and try to avoid some of these convoluted pathways (and weak
links) to the programs.  Undoubtedly I haven't considered something.
But I wanted to make the suggestion anyway. 

The README says:
----------------------------------------------------
This program is to decide if it should run
etc/interactive programs or etc/command programs.

It should live in etc/front.end and be linked to
names in bin that have programs/shell scripts in
etc/interactive and etc/command of the same name:

ln etc/front.end bin/window
for etc/command/window and etc/interactive/window

When user runs window, this executes etc/front.end
but argv[0] will have the name "window", which
front.end will use to build the two program names
etc/interactive/window and etc/command/window.
---------------------------------------------------

But, generally we have been eliminating this distinction between
interactive and command scripts.  It's easy enough for an interactive
only program to do something like:

--------------------------------------
if (argc > 1)
  { 
    G_fatal_error ("This program must be run interactively.");
  }
--------------------------------------

or probably better (even though it's more code...)

--------------------------------------
struct GModule *mod;

G_gisinit(argv[0]);

mod = G_define_module();
mod->description = "pgm -- do xyz interactive thing." ;

/* No options */

if(!G_parser())
    exit(-1);

if (!isatty())
   G_fatal_error ("This program must be run interactively!");
--------------------------------------
