            TAVL library public functions, types & constants
            ------------------------------------------------

                            ---------
                            CONSTANTS
                            ---------

                               -----
                               TYPES
                               -----

TAVL_treeptr        Pointer to a TAVL tree.  Most tavl library
                    functions require a TAVL_tree pointer as the
                    first parameter.  A valid TAVL_treeptr can
                    only be obtained via the function "tavl_init",
                    which returns a TAVL_treeptr which can then be
                    used as a parameter for other TAVL functions.
                    All fields in *TAVL_treeptr are absolutely,
                    unequivocally PRIVATE.  No point in even
                    reading them.

TAVL_nodeptr        Pointer to a TAVL tree node.  Many TAVL functions
                    require a TAVL_nodeptr as parameter, or return a
                    TAVL_nodeptr.  Fields within *TAVL_nodeptr are
                    PRIVATE - with one possible, but unnecessary,
                    exception: TAVL_nodeptr->dataptr - in which case
                    it is READONLY.
                        Data should be obtained from a TAVL_nodeptr
                    via the function "tavl_getdata", rather than
                    reading "dataptr" directly.


                        -----------------
                            FUNCTIONS
                        -----------------

TAVL_INIT
---------
    purpose:        Creates a new TAVL tree. Returned pointer is used
                    as a parameter to TAVL routines in subsequent
                    processing.

    source file:    tavlinit.c
    returns:        pointer to empty tree, or NULL if
                    insufficient memory.

    prototype:      TAVL_treeptr tavl_init(
                            int (*compare)(void *Key1, void *Key2),
                            void *(*key_of)(void *DataObject),
                            void *(*make_item)(const void *DataObject),
                            void (*free_item)(void *DataObject),
                            void *(*copy_item)(void *Dest_DataObject,
                                         const void *Source_DataObject),
                            void *(*alloc)(size_t),
                            void (*dealloc)(void *)
                    );

    parameters: All parameters for tavl_init are pointers to functions,
                so that you can tailor the behavior of the tavltree and
                the data it stores to fit the needs of your application.

                compare   - Exclusively defines how the tavl library will
                            make comparisons for this tree.
                              must return:
                                        0 - (Key1 == Key2)
                                       >0 - (Key1 > Key2)
                                       <0 - (Key1 < Key2)

                key_of    - Must return a pointer to the identifier of
                            data objects which are being inserted into
                            this instance of tavl tree. Within the TAVL
                            library, result of the "key_of" function is
                            passed directly to the "compare" function.

                            (Identifier - that which distinguishes this
                            data object from other data objects.
                            Its "name".)

                make_item - Must create a copy of the data object passed
                            to it. This function is also responsible for
                            allocating memory necessary for storing the
                            copy of the data object.  Library function
                            tavl_insert uses "make_item" to make a copy
                            of the item, or object, to insert into the
                            tree, and library function tavl_setdata uses
                            "make_item" to create a copy of the data
                            item passed to it.

                free_item - Opposite of make_item. Function "free_item"
                            must free or deallocate memory given to
                            the object by "make_item".

                copy_item - Copies a data object to a buffer.  All memory
                            necessary to store the object must have been
                            allocated before "copy_item" is called.

                alloc     - A memory allocator for the tavl library to
                            use for its private purposes, ie, allocation
                            of nodes and struct tavltree.

                dealloc   - Counterpart to "alloc".

                  Often "alloc" & "dealloc" will be the complementary
                  C library functions "malloc" and "free".



TAVL_INSERT
-----------
   purpose:     Inserts data objects into the tree.

   source file: tavl_ins.c

   returns:     A pointer to the node which contains the data object
                inserted or found.

   prototype:   TAVL_nodeptr tavl_insert(
                                TAVL_treeptr tree,
                                void        *item,
                                int          replace
                                );

   parameters:  tree -      Pointer to the tree into which data will be
                            inserted.

                item -      Pointer to the object to insert.

                replace -   Instructs "tavl_insert" on how to behave
                            if the tree already contains a data object
                            whose identifier equals key_of(item).
                            If replace != 0, the new data object will
                            replace the old, otherwise nothing happens,
                            tavl_insert simply returns a pointer to
                            the found node.

    NOTES:      "tavl_insert" requires the private function
                "rebalance_tavl" contained in source file "tavlrebl.c",
                so the module "tavlrebl.obj" (or whatever, depending on
                your system) must be linked to the final executable
                program.


TAVL_DELETE
-----------
    purpose:        Deletes node containing item such that
                    *key_of(node.item) == *key.

    source file:    tavl_del.c

    returns:        1 if successful, otherwise 0.

    prototype:      int tavl_delete(TAVL_treeptr tree, void *key);

    parameters:     tree -  Tree to remove object from.
                    key  -  Identifier of object to remove.

    NOTES:      "tavl_delete" requires the private function
                "rebalance_tavl" contained in source file "tavlrebl.c",
                so the module "tavlrebl.obj" (or whatever, depending on
                your system) must be linked to the final executable
                program.



TAVL_FIND
---------
    purpose:        Find node whose data object's identifier
                    equals *key.

    source file:    tavlfind.c

    prototype:      TAVL_nodeptr tavl_find(TAVL_treeptr tree, void *key);

    parameters:     tree -  Tree to search.
                    key  -  Identifier of object to find.




TAVL_GETDATA        source file: tavl_gdt.c
------------
    purpose:        Copies data object contained in *p to *buffer.
                    Uses function "copy_item" to accomplish its
                    mission; see tavl_init.

    returns:        Result of function "copy_item"; if all is OK,
                    this should be a void pointer to parameter "buffer",
                    but definition of "copy_item" is left to
                    the TAVL-library user.

    prototype:      void *tavl_getdata(
                            TAVL_treeptr tree,
                            TAVL_nodeptr p,
                            void *buffer);




TAVL_SETDATA        source file: tavl_sdt.c
------------
    purpose:        Directly replace the data object contained in
                    node "p".  Fails if identifier of object in
                    node "p" does not equal identifier of "item".
                    NOTE: this function has same effect as
                    "tavl_insert(tree,item,REPLACE)" where it is
                    known that an object exists in the tree such
                    that *key_of(item) == *key_of(existing_object).


    returns:        if successful   ........... TAVL_OK
                    if insufficient memory .... TAVL_NOMEM
                    if illegal operation ...... TAVL_ILLEGAL_OP,
                      where an illegal operation is either
                      trying to set data on the head node
                      (returned by tavl_reset), or trying
                      to replace the existing data object
                      with an object whose identifier is
                      not equal to the original object's
                      identifier.

    prototype:      int tavl_setdata(
                            TAVL_treeptr tree,
                            TAVL_nodeptr p,
                            void *item);

    parameters:     tree -  Pointer to the tree in question.
                    p    -  Pointer to the node containing
                            object to replace.
                    item -  Pointer to replacement item.




TAVL_DELETE_ALL     source file: tavldall.c
---------------
    purpose:        Remove all data nodes from the tree and
                    release memory used by those nodes.

    prototype:      void tavl_delete_all(TAVL_treeptr tree);

    NOTES:      "tavl_delete_all" uses TAVL library functions
                "tavl_reset" and "tavl_succ", so these
                modules must be linked to the final executable.




TAVL_DESTROY        source file:    tavlfree.c
------------
    purpose:        Release all memory used by the tree and
                    its data nodes; i.e., destroy the tree.

    prototype:      void tavl_destroy(TAVL_treeptr tree);

    NOTES:      "tavl_destroy" uses TAVL library functions
                "tavl_reset" and "tavl_succ", so these
                modules must be linked to the final executable.



  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Following three functions allow you to treat tavl_trees as a     |
  | doubly linked sorted list with a head node.  This is the point   |
  | of threaded trees - it is almost as efficient to move from node  |
  | to node or back with a threaded tree as it is with a linked list.|
  --------------------------------------------------------------------


TAVL_RESET          source file: tavl_rst.c
----------
    purpose:        Used in conjunction with "tavl_succ" & "tavl_pred",
                    "tavl_reset" returns a pointer to the head node
                    of the tree. The head node contains no data,
                    rather it is the begin/end of the tree viewed as
                    a sorted doubly linked circular list. Subsequent
                    call to "tavl_succ"/"tavl_pred" returns first/last
                    (or least/greatest) node of this list.

    prototype:      TAVL_nodeptr tavl_reset(TAVL_treeptr tree);



TAVL_SUCC           source file: tavlsucc.c
---------
    purpose:        Returns pointer to node that is the in-order
                    successor of node p, or NULL if p is last
                    element in the list (head doesn't count).
                    Input parameter "p" may be obtained from
                    the functions "tavl_reset", "tavl_find",
                    "tavl_insert", or "tavl_pred".

    prototype:      TAVL_nodeptr tavl_succ(TAVL_nodeptr p);



TAVL_PRED           source file: tavlpred.c
---------
    purpose:        Returns in-order predecessor of "p";
                    almost the inverse of tavl_succ. I.e.,

                       p == tavl_pred(tavl_succ(p))
                    and
                       p == tavl_succ(tavl_pred(p))

                    EXCEPT! when the inner function in
                    the relationship above returns NULL
                    because it has reached begin/end of
                    the list (tree).

    prototype:      TAVL_nodeptr tavl_pred(TAVL_nodeptr p);

function:

REBALANCE_TAVL      source-file: tavlrebl.c
--------------

    purpose:        Used internally by the "tavl_insert"
                    and "tavl_delete" functions.  Should
                    NEVER, EVER, be called by an application.
                    But if it was, it wouldn't harm anything -
                    since the tree is always balanced at application
                    level, a call to rebalance would simply return
                    with no changes or actions taken.

    prototype:      In source file "tavlpriv.h", which must be present
                    when compiling TAVL library routines.


types:

typedef struct tavlnode {
            void *dataptr;
            struct tavlnode *Lptr, *Rptr;
            signed   int bf     : 3;    /* assumes values -2..+2 */
            unsigned int Lbit   : 1;
            unsigned int Rbit   : 1;
        } TAVL_NODE, *TAVL_nodeptr;

    fields:

    dataptr:
            Pointer to the data object stored in this node.

    Lptr,Rptr:
            Pointers to either left/right child trees, or predecessor/
            successor nodes, depending on state of Lbit, Rbit flags.

    bf:     In a balanced tree, -1 <= bf <= +1.  When inserting or deleting,
            bf may become == abs(2); this signals these routines that the
            tree must be rebalanced, starting at the unbalanced node.

    Lbit,Rbit:
            Flags that determine if Rptr, Lptr are links to child trees
            or threads to in-order predecessor/successor nodes.


typedef struct tavltree {
            TAVL_nodeptr head;
            int (*cmp)(void *, void *);
            void *(*key_of)(void *);
            void *(*make_item)(const void *);
            void (*free_item)(void *);
            void *(*copy_item)(void *, const void *);
            void *(*alloc)(size_t);
            void (*dealloc)(void *);
        } TAVL_TREE, *TAVL_treeptr;


    fields: "head" is a non-data node created at initialization;
            algorithms dealing with the tree are simplified by
            its presence. "head" is also the pointer returned
            by the TAVL-library function "tavl_reset", and serves
            as a marker to begin/end of the tree-as-sorted-list.

            All the other fields are function pointers set at
            initialization time; see "tavl_init".  TAVL library
            routines perform the functions named by these functions
            exclusively through the use of these function pointers.
