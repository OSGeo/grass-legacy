<h2>LRS (Linear Reference System)</h2>
LRS uses linear features and distance measured along those features
to positionate objects. 
LRS is created from input lines and points in vector map. 
Points - MP (mileposts) must have attached attributes specifying 
line and distance. 
The distances from the beginning of the linear feature in real world
are specified by MP+offset. 
Typicaly MP is in kilometers and offset in meters.

<p>
The implementation of LRS in GRASS has some particularities.

<h3>Double referenced system.</h3>
This feature gives a possibility to continue to use most of 
old mileposts if only small part of linear object in real world
has changed. Example:
<div class="code"><pre>
--- road (linear feature)
 +   MP (milepost, point, distance from the beginning in km)
</pre></div>

Old situation:

<div class="code"><pre>
+----+----+----+----+----+ 
0    2    3    4    5    6
</pre></div>

New situation (for example a new bypass around the village)

<div class="code"><pre>
          ?    ?
          +----+
          |    |
          |    |
+----+----+    +----+----+ 
0    2    3    4    5    6
</pre></div>

The segment between km 3 and 4 is now longer, it is now 3 km 
not 1 km as in old version. It would be expensive to change also 
all MP &gt;= 4, but we cannot use km 4 twice.
It is possible to use another notation for the new segment, 
we reference the segment from the kilometer 3, using only offset.

<div class="code"><pre>
      3+1000  3+2000
          +----+
          |    |
          |    |
+----+----+    +----+----+ 
0    2    3  3+3000 5    6
               4
</pre></div>

This way, there is no ambiguity and minimal changes are needed. 
But the MP 4 is no more the end of segment 3 - 4 but 
the end of segment 3+2000 - 3+3000. This information
must be entered to the system and it is done by optional MP attributes:

<ul>
<li>end_mp - end MP
<li>end_off - end offset
</ul>
In this case original MP on km 4 will have these attributes:
<div class="code"><pre>
start_mp:  4
start_off: 0
end_mp:    3
end_off:   3000
</pre></div>

Because each MP can keep 2 values (start, end) it is called 'double' referenced LRS.
<p>
To avoid possible confusions, MP values, are limited to integers only. 
It would be ambiguous to have for example segments 3.500 - 3.500+200 
and 3.600 - 3.600+200. The position 3+650 would fall into 2 segments, 
correct would be 3.600+50. 
That means, that MP must be the beginning of antonomous segment 
and all parts which becomes longer then before must be referenced 
from the last not changed MP.
<p>
The MP start_mp and end_mp columns may be decimal, but v.lrs.create takes the decimal part, 
and adds its value to offset and print a warning.


<h3>Input lines for v.lrs.segment and v.lrs.label</h3>
v.lrs.create joins all connected lines of the same line ID into one line, 
the LRS library and other modules using LRS expect this!
LR_get_nearest_offset in the LRS library checks duplicate segments only
by line_cat and map_offset, not by coordinates in map.

<h3>Duplicate positions</h3>
It can happen that one offset appears on 2 different lines:
<div class="code"><pre>
------1-------     --------2------
+0.0            +1.0              +2.0
</pre></div>
In this case, the module gives error because the position
results in 2 points.

<p>
It can be also intended, for example a part of the road is shared
with another one, but MP are used only for one:
<div class="code"><pre>
 + road1/km15         + road1/km22
  \                  /
   \ road1/km17     / road1/km20
    +--------------+ 
   / road2/km52     \ road2/km52
  /                  \
 + road2/km50         + road2/km54 
</pre></div>
