<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.iso</em> splits net to bands between cost isolines (direction from
centre). Centre node must be opened (costs >= 0). Costs of centre node are 
used in calculation. Supported are cost assignments for both arcs and nodes, 
and also different in both directions of a vector line. For areas cost will 
be calculated along boundary lines.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Nodes must be on the isolines.<P>

Center nodes have to be assigned to vector nodes. Nodes and arcs can be closed 
using cost = -1. 

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Subdivision of a network into areas:<br>

The map must contain at least one center
(point) on the vector network which can be patched into with
<a HREF="v.patch.html">v.patch</a>.

<pre>
v.net.iso input=streets output=isomap ccats=1 costs=1000,2000,5000
</pre>

that should cut network to 4 categories:

<pre>
cat | distance from point
1          0 - 1000
2       1000 - 2000
3       2000 - 5000
4            > 5000
</pre>

To see the result, run for example:

<pre>
d.vect isomap col=green  cats=1
d.vect isomap col=yellow cats=2
d.vect isomap col=orange cats=3
d.vect isomap col=red    cats=4
</pre>
