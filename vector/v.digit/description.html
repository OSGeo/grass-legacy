<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.digit</em> is a vector map digitizer with graphical user interface.
Attribute tables can be directly generated while digitizing (define in
"Settings" first).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The <b>bgcmd</b> option is intended to be used with display (d.*) commands.
If several display commands are to be used to render the background
they should be separated with the semi-colon ';' character.
When run from the command line, these display commands will generally
need to be "quoted" as they will contain spaces (see examples).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h4>Start a monitor and display a raster to help setup and zoom to area of interest</h4>
<pre>
    d.mon x0
    d.rast name_of_raster
</pre>

<p>

<h4>Digitizing an area based on a existing raster map; creating a new vector map</h4>
<pre>
    v.digit -n map=name_of_new_vector_map bgcmd="d.rast map=name_of_raster"
</pre>
<p>
The "<b>-n</b>" flag specifies that your vector map does not yet exist and
thus will be created with the name given by "<b>map=</b>". "<b>bgcmd=</b>"
specifies a display (d.*) command and is set in "quotes" as it contains a space.
<p>
The <em>v.digit</em> GUI appears -- after exiting <em>v.digit</em> GUI the 
vector map "name_of_new_vector_map" is created.
<P>
After leaving <em>v.digit</em>, run:
<pre>
    d.erase
    d.vect "name_of_new_vector_map" 
</pre>
The display should be cleared and the newly created vector should appear in 
the monitor.
<p>

<h4>Digitizing a second vector, using your first vector and the raster image
as background</h4>
<p>
<pre>
    v.digit -n map=name_of_second_vector \
      bgcmd="d.rast map=name_of_your_raster; d.vect map=name_of_new_vector_map"
</pre>
<p>
The <em>v.digit</em> GUI appears and the layers defined with <b>bgcmd</b>
are displayed in the background. As the <b>bgcmd</b> commands are executed 
as a series of commands (separated by a ";"), the last command (d.vect)
displays over the top of the earlier raster image.<br>
<p>

<h4> Combining <b>bgcmd</b> with <em>d.save</em> to use the existing
display as a backdrop</h4>
<P>
<pre>
    v.digit map=name bgcmd="`d.save -o | cut -f1 -d'#' | tr '\n' ';'`"
</pre>
<a href="d.save.html"><em>d.save</em></a> will list the commands used to draw
the current display; <em>cut</em> and <em>tr</em> are UNIX commands which are
used to remove comments and trade newlines for semi-colons, respectively.
