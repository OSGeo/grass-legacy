Subject: [NVIZ] NVIZ-todo-bugs-problems

I am testing the LINUX version of NVIZ thouroughly
and here are some of my findings, so that you don't have to wonder
why some things don't work as expected.
Don't get discouraged by the long list, the NVIZ is still great
and I got a lot done with it for my presentation at GISC2000 -
it just needs continuing improvements.

(Markus, this is updated from what I gave you before.)

NVIZ2.2 runs pretty well on LINUX, however there are several 
things which are 

1. missing/not working which worked in SGI version
-------------------------------------------------
1.0 For certain combination of zscale and resolution the surface
does not render completely (only its parts), you have to lower
zscale to get it render completely - this may be caused by
limits in OPENGL or the integer normals issue (see problem 1.2)

 - 2/2002 not working or tested as expected

1.1 Scripting is not there at all, if I remember correctly
it did not work in the SGI OpenGL version but it worked very well
in the original SGI version - it is a powerful tool for 
doing complex animations (especially if you know tcl/tk,
but even if you don't know it the tutorial and GUI is good enough
to be able to some advanced dynamic visualization.
Does anybody know where the script_tools are?
 
 - 2/2002 Scripting needs more testing, but it seems to be working in
         principle.


[1.2  lights - fixed by Bob Covill.]

[1.3 - fixed by Bob Covill.]

1.4 when mask is removed it still draws a hole there
 but otherwise the mask seems to be working OK.

 - 2/2002 needs testing

1.5 After hitting the maximum site files loaded, it correctly displays
an error but then hangs-on with "please wait" (probably trying
to load them - it should return back where it was
and not attempt to load)

1.6 Most of you have probably already experienced the following feature:
for a mysterious reason the rendered image is occasionally replaced by the 
grid mesh image - on SGI it happened when you moved the mouse accross
the height or zscale slide, but on LINUX it happens even more often, We
spent quite a bit of time with Bill trying to find out what it is
with no success. Whoever fixes this should win a prize.

 - Under RedHat7.2 with GRASSCVS from december 2001 it happens rarely, but
   it is still there.

2. things which were in SG3d but were never ported to nviz
----------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Legends, labels, including labels for sites
2.2 Scale, north
2.3 More options for display of sites based on their attributes
2.4 Display of lat/long data on a sphere (globe) or its part

3. Experimental capabilities for combining volumes and surfaces in sg4d
----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Integration of r3.showdspf with surface visualization

4. Capabilities of nviz added to some older versions but not included in the
   release
---------------------------------------------------
4.1 Where it will draw a flow line from a queried point


other than that it runs great so far - although I haven't yet tried
everything
