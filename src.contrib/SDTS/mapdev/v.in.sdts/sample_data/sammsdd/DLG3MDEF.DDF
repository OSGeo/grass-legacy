This attribute identifies an area delineated by symbols 500(A), 112.78(B), 523.10(C), or 2502.01(D).  Code 300 0103 is not used for ahupuaas because they are not part of the Public Land Survey System.  Hawaii is divided into five counties.  Four of the counties are subdivided into districts.  Districts are subdivided into smaller areas called ahupuaas, and ahupuaas are subdivided into small land divisions called ilis and leles.  The boundaries of ilis and leles are not collected.  A further land subdivision shown on 1:24,000- Scale maps in Hawaii is the homestead.  The homesteads are much smaller than the ahupuaas, generally less than a square mile.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00795 D     00041   310400010020DDDF75224MDEF4ATTAMENDEDThis attribute identifies a contour element added by interpolation after map compilation and is limited to contour segments added or modified to correct compilation errors.  An amended contour is assumed to be a standard index or intermediate contour by default unless qualified by additional attributes, such as SUPPLEMENTARY.  The application of this attribute is very conservative and is restricted to those areas where it is imperative to correct a minor compilation error in order to make the hypsographic file logical.  This attribute should not be used over extensive problem areas, where it would be preferable to revise and recompile the contour separate.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00419 D     00041   310400010020DDDF37625MDEF5ATTAPPROXIMATEThis code identifies contours in areas where accurate representation is not attainable through normal compilation procedures.

This code identifies hypsography depicted in areas of dense or complex relief where the value of a given contour cannot be absolutely determined from the source material.  This attribute is used in conjunction with an elevation parameter attribute.  In areas where contour feathering occurs, elevations for the feathered segments can generally be determined by referring to the compilation specifications for feathered areas.  These specifications state that the last contour segment dropped in a constricted area is the first one to begin again as soon as space is available.  The compilation specifications also state that when the space between index contours limits the showing of intermediate contours, the intermediate contours are compiled following the order of retention rule, which states the priority for portrayal as follows:  the highest intermediate, the lowest, the second highest, and the second lowest.  Only when the elevation cannot be clearly determined by using these guidelines is the BEST_ESTIMATE attribute also applied to the contour segments carrying an estimated elevation.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00286 D     00041   310400010030DDDF242311MDEF11ATTCITYIncorporated city, village, town, borough, or hamlet.

Hawaii is divided into five counties.  Four of the counties are subdivided into districts.  Districts are subdivided into smaller areas called ahupuaas, and ahupuaas are subdivided into small land divisions called ilis and leles.  The boundaries of ilis and leles are not collected.

This code corresponds to "existent" corners as defined in the Bureau of Land Management's Manual of Instructions for the Survey of the Public Lands (1973).  It indicates that physical evidence of the corner was recovered during field operations.  Such a corner is shown by a double-weight (0.01 inch) cross or "T" on symbols 506, 507 (A); 523.5, 523.6 (C); or 2502.07, 2502.08 (D) on the published map.  Note that all meander (300 0004), witness (300 0007), and quarter-section (300 0012) corners  also bear this attribute, because they are only mapped if recovered.  On some older maps, a single-weight (0.005 inch) cross or "T" denotes an indicated corner.  Such corners do not receive this attribute.  The code is also used in conjunction with the land grant corner (300 0014) when a found land grant monument, symbols 501(A), 523.11(C), or 2502.02(D), is depicted.  When a land grant is coincident with a boundary, the boundary symbol takes precedence.  If, however, a recovered monument was established to mark the grant boundary, it is shown by symbol 501 on the red plate and is coded as a found grant corner.  Monuments shown by symbols 226(A) or 512.105(C) on the black plate are boundary monuments and are captured in the boundaries category.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00466 D     00041   310400010030DDDF422336MDEF36ATTINTERMITTENTThis attribute describes any hydrographic feature, such as stream, pond, or canal, that is depicted by an intermittent symbol, such as 405, 412, 417, 420 (A); 141.6(B); 541.7, 541.32 (C) or 2202.02, 2203.05, 2204.02, 2204.05 (D).

The spillway is digitized as a node, area, line, or degenerate line according to the size of the feature.  If it is shown by a small circle or dot, it is digitized as a degenerate line.  If the feature is shown by drainage lines, perennial or intermittent, it is digitized as a line.  If the spillway is indicated by an arrangement of contour lines or a black box, it is digitized as an area.  If a spillway is represented as an integral part of the dam, this entity label and an elevation value (if applicable) are assigned to a node on the digitized line of the dam.  Some judgment is required to correctly digitize the spillway, as the feature is not always labeled.  The label "Spillway elevation NNNN" placed in the impounded water area is sometimes the only reference to the feature.  If the feature itself is represented by a label only, this entity label and the elevation value are assigned to a node placed on the digitized shoreline near the label.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00468 D     00041   310400010040DDDF4234162MDEF162ENT0500409Gate (flood, tidal, head, or check.)

A penstock is an underground or exposed pipe conveying water from a canal or a dam to a hydroelectric plant.  It is usually shown as a single-line feature, that is digitized as a line.  The penstock may be carried underground in an aqueduct tunnel, symbols 424(A), 141.23(B), or 2204.08(D), in which case the single line is digitized and carries the additional code for tunnel (050 0604).

A wash is encoded as a hydrographic feature because it is an integral part of a stream network, generally found in arid areas and often associated with intermittent drainage.  This entity label applies to symbols 409(A), 141.6(B), 541.13(C), or 2202.06(D) only when the feature is labeled as a wash.  Any single-line drainage that is found in an areal wash, shown by symbol 541.14(C), is coded as appropriate.  A wash is an ephemeral drainage feature because it is normally dry, but can contain runoff from heavy storms or snowmelt for a few hours.  The edge of an areal wash pattern is coded as apparent limit (050 0204), unless the limits are defined by a hydrographic feature such as a double-line intermittent stream, then it is coded as right bank (050 0605), left bank (050 0606), and intermittent (050 0610).  Perennial features labeled as wash carry only the perennial stream code.  Sand areas adjacent to double-line perennial streams are not coded as washes, but as sand in the Nonvegetative Features data category.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00797 D     00041   310400010040DDDF7524174MDEF174ENT0500421Lake or pond.

A coral reef or rock reef is digitized as an area if greater than 0.030 inch in diameter.  An unattributed line is digitized around the outside of the reef pattern.  If there is a brown tint inside the reef pattern, the inference is that the reef uncovers at low water and the area should also be coded as "flat" (050 0115).  If there is no brown tint inside of the reef pattern, the inference is that the reef is always submerged and the area should be coded only (050 0422).

When groups of buildings or street patterns represent the locality, digitize a line depicting the limits of the area, which includes the name or label and related buildings and streets (see code 200 0250).  When the symbol 112.42(B) represents the locality, digitize a degenerate line on the dot and identify it with this code.  If the locality is shown by a road intersection, digitize a degenerate line at the intersection and identify it with this code.  If a locality is named for a point feature appearing on the map, and there are no other features, e.g., buildings, digitize a degenerate line on the symbol.  However, if the symbol does not appear on the map, then digitize a degenerate line near the name.  In addition, if the locality is labeled as unincorporated, also use code 200 0615; if unpopulated, use code 200 0616.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00272 D     00041   310400010040DDDF2274379MDEF379ENT2000411Amphitheater.

This point exists at an extremity of a section boundary and wherever two section lines meet or cross.  It is normally surrounded by three or four distinct sections.  This code includes standard corners (on a standard parallel or base line) and township corners (at an extremity of a township boundary).  Found section corners are shown by symbols 506(A), 523.5(C), or 2502.07(D).  Indicated section corners may be shown by symbol 506(A).  Unfound corners are not explicitly  symbolized.    This  code  is  also  used  for section corners that are not symbolized because of feature coincidence, such as  a corner at a road intersection.  Corners coincident with a boundary also carry code 309 0009 (coincident with monumented point on boundary, 90 0001).USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00196 D     00041   310400010040DDDF1514417MDEF417ENT3000002Point on section line.

This is a corner established at the intersection of a surveyed line with a previously established boundary at a point between corners.  It is shown by symbols 507(A), 523.6(C), or 2502.08(D).  In general, there are three cases of the occurrence of closing corners:  Error introduced into the rectangular system because of the convergence of meridians is taken up at standard parallels, normally established every 24 miles along the principal meridian.  On the standard parallels, there are offsets in the meridional lines and two sets of corners--standard corners (300 0001) for the lines to the north and closing corners for the lines from the south.  Township and section lines may be made closure lines to maintain rectangularity.  Measurement error, corrected on extension or resurvey, can result in double sets of corners and are shown on the map by offset lines.  The south and east boundaries are normally the governing lines of a survey; therefore, for digitizing purposes, corners at lines to the south and to the east are considered the closing corners.  Closing corners are also established where the lines of the rectangular system intersect or close on the boundaries of grants or reservations, on State boundaries, or on some other previously established survey that is irregular as to plan.  A closing corner is coded whenever a survey line closes on or crosses a boundary that delimits the public lands.  If the reservation boundary is coincident with a township or range line, the exterior township corners that are coincident with the reservation boundary are not closing corners and should not be attributed as closing corners.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00867 D     00041   310400010040DDDF8224419MDEF419ENT3000004Meander corner.  The beds of navigable bodies of water are not public domain and are not subject to survey and disposal by the United States.  At every point where a section line intersects the banks of such a feature, a meander corner is established, and a metes and bounds traverse, called a meander line, is run to segregate the water area from the public lands.  Meander lines are not mapped.  Meander corners are shown only when recovered during field work; they are depicted as a double-weight (0.01 inch) "T", and are labeled "MC" as shown by symbols 523(A), 523.7(C) or 2502.10(D).  Unless the symbol and label are present, an unattributed node should be placed at the point where the section line is broken by a water body.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00568 D     00041   310400010040DDDF5234420MDEF420ENT3000005Auxiliary meander corner.  When a lake of greater than 50 acres lies completely within a quarter section or an island too small to subdivide lies completely within a section, an auxiliary meander corner is established at any point on the shoreline and tied to the nearest regular corner.  A meander line is then run from the auxiliary meander corner.  Recovered auxiliary meander corners are shown with a monument symbol and labeled.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00601 D     00041   310400010040DDDF5564421MDEF421ENT3000006Special meander corner.  When a lake of greater than 50 acres lies completely within a section, a special meander corner is established at an intersection of the center line of the section with the bank of the lake, and a meander line is run from the corner.  Special meander corners are also established at the intersections of surveyed subdivision of section lines and meander lines.  Recovered special meander corners are shown with a monument symbol and labeled.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division01009 D     00041   310400010040DDDF9644422MDEF422ENT3000007Witness corner.  A witness corner is established if the true corner cannot be marked in the usual manner because of obstructions or difficult terrain.  It is located on the section line within 10 chains (660 feet) or anywhere within 5 chains (330 feet) of the actual corner.  Normally, only one witness corner is established in each instance.  For example, witness corners are commonly established on secure ground when the true position of a meander corner falls at a point where the monument would be likely to be destroyed by the effects of tide, waves, or ice.  Witness corners are only mapped if they are recovered; they are depicted as a double weight (0.01 inch) "T" and labeled "WC" as shown in symbols 523(A), 523.7(C), or 2502.09(D).  If a witness corner is depicted that does not fall on a public land line, it is captured as a degenerate line feature (300 0302).USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00438 D     00041   310400010040DDDF3934423MDEF423ENT3000008Witness point.  This is a monumented station on a survey line marking an important location remote from and not related to a regular corner (for example, a road or stream crossing).

This is a point in a survey marking a change in azimuth of an irregular boundary line.  Recovered angle points are sometimes shown with the identified (found) corner symbol as shown by symbols 506, 507 (A); 523.5, 523.6 (C); or 2502.07, 2502.08 (D) and labeled "AP".  Angle points that are not recovered are not captured as nodes, but rather are treated as inflection points of line features.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division01278 D     00043   4104000100040DDDF12314425MDEF425ENT3000010Location monument (includes amended monument and mineral monument.)  Location monuments mark fixed reference points supplementing the regular public land survey.  There are three distinct occurrences of this feature:  Mineral monument - These monuments are established during surveys of the irregular boundaries of mining claims when no public land corners have been established in the vicinity.  When the public land surveys are subsequently extended to the area, the mineral monument is tied to a regular section corner.  Amended monument - Defective township exteriors that were not closed upon and from which subdivisional lines were not run are obliterated after a resurvey.  If, however, another survey was tied to a defective corner, that corner is retained as an amended monument.  Location monuments - These monuments are depicted as a filled triangle on the black plate as shown by symbols 227(A), 112.46(B), 512.106(C), or 2102.12(D) and are usually labeled with identifying letters and numbers.  In  most  cases  a  location  monument  does  not fall on a public land line and is captured as a degenerate line feature (300 0300).USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00443 D     00041   310400010040DDDF3984426MDEF426ENT3000011Reference monument.  This is an accessory placed near a corner that cannot be permanently marked, for example, the corner falls within a roadway and nearby bearing objects are not available.  It is shown by symbols 226(A) or 512.105(C).  Accessories may be searched for and mapped when corners are not found.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00594 D     00041   310400010040DDDF5494427MDEF427ENT3000012Quarter-section corner.  This is a corner at the extremity of a quarter-section boundary, theoretically located halfway (40 chains) between section corners.  Normally, quarter-section corners are not searched for or plotted unless there is a bend in the line at the corner or the section corners on either side cannot be recovered.  This code is only used when the identified (found) corner symbol as shown by symbols 506(A), 523.5(C), or 2502.07(D) is shown.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00816 D     00041   310400010040DDDF7714428MDEF428ENT3000013Tract corner.  A tract corner is an angle point, or change in azimuth, on a tract boundary.  In modern public land survey, the term tract is used to mean a parcel of land that lies in more than one section or cannot be identified in whole as part of a particular section.  Tract boundaries are not mapped unless they are needed to show the limits of the land net.  In this case, the extreme boundaries only are shown by the symbols 500(A), 523.10(C), or 2502.01(D).  It is not always possible to differentiate between tracts and grants based on the published map.  The grant corner code is only used when the identification of the feature as a tract corner is definite and obvious.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division01379 D     00043   4104000100040DDDF13324429MDEF429ENT3000014Land grant or donation land claim corner.  A land grant or donation land claim (DLC) corner is an angle point, or change in azimuth, on a grant or DLC boundary.  In many States, there are irregular grant boundaries that were established prior to the original public land subdivisional surveys.  Donation land claims were established in Oregon and Washington prior to public land subdivisional surveys.  Grant and DLC boundaries are shown by symbols 500(A), 523.10(C), or 2502.01(D).  This code is used whenever a node is placed at an angle point on a grant or DLC boundary.  However, angle points on these boundaries are digitized as inflection points of linear features unless:  (1) a found land grant monument symbols 501(A), 523.11(C), or 2502.02(D) is shown, or (2) another surveyed line intersects the grant or DLC boundary at that point.  Where the public land lines close on or intersect grant or DLC boundaries, the closing corner code (300 0003) is used.  If the intersection is at an angle point on the grant or DLC boundary, the "Land grant or DLC corner" code is also assigned.  Nodes placed where grants intersect the neatline of the map or where grant lines are broken for features of higher order symbology, have no attributes.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00505 D     00041   310400010040DDDF4604430MDEF430ENT3000015Arbitrary section corner.  This code is used when a node is placed in the approximate location of the true corner to effect closure of the land line network.  Joining to an arbitrary section corner is one of three methods of closing polygons to complete the definition of a coherent overlay.  Polygon closure is discussed in detail in section 3.12.5 (see code 300 0203).USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00749 D     00041   310400010040DDDF7044431MDEF431ENT3000100Indian lands.  Land granted to the native Indians is excluded from the public domain.  Tribal lands are shown on published maps with the reservation boundary shown by symbols 207(A), 123.6(B), 512.128(C), or 2107.05(D).  The reservation name is placed across the bounded area.  Boundaries of abandoned reservations that are limiting lines of subdivision surveys are shown on maps with the section line symbol and labeled "Old Indian Treaty Boundary" as shown by symbol 523.14(C).  When these lines do not limit the public lands, they are digitized only on the boundaries overlay and are coded as "Historical line."USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00605 D     00041   310400010040DDDF5604432MDEF432ENT3000101Homestead entries.  Title to portions of the public domain was granted to individuals under the various homestead acts on the basis of residence, cultivation, and some improvement to the land over several years.  The use of this code is somewhat limited   because  homestead  entries   cannot  reliably  be  identified  on  published  maps.    This  code  is not used for tracts of land in Hawaii that are labeled as homesteads because Hawaii is not a public land state.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00889 D     00041   310400010040DDDF8444433MDEF433ENT3000102Donation land claims.  Tracts of land (160, 320, or 640 acres) were allocated to settlers in the Oregon Territory who had resided on and cultivated the land for 4 years under the Donation Act of September 27, 1850; to settlers in Florida under the Act of August 4, 1842; and to settlers in New Mexico under the Act of July 22, 1854.  The boundaries of these areas are shown by symbols 500(A), 123.5(B), 523.10(C), or 2502.01(D) and the areas are usually numbered within a township.  Within the affected areas, polygons bounded by the grant line symbol are coded as donation land claims.  In addition, these areas are normally assigned the land grant identifier code (307 ----).  Angle points on the boundaries are coded as grant corners when appropriate.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00693 D     00041   310400010040DDDF6484434MDEF434ENT3000103Land grants or civil colonies.

Arbitrary lines must occasionally be digitized to effect closure of all polygons of a PLSS file.  This most frequently occurs where land lines intersect navigable bodies of water because the actual meander lines are not mapped.  Closure lines may be digitized in one of the following ways: - as straight line segments joining existing nodes, - as approximate metes and bounds (distance and direction) traverses along the limits of another feature, or - as straight line extensions to an arbitrary section corner (300 0015).  In positioning arbitrary closure lines at water bodies, consider that meander lines are run in original surveys not as boundaries but to define the sinuosity of the feature, and as a means of ascertaining the quantity of land remaining after segregation of the water area.  They are run as a series of straight line segments that approximate the true margin of the feature.  Thus a major consideration in digitizing these lines is to avoid introducing excessive error into computations of land area.  It is also important to note that the position of bodies of water may change over time, but surveyed lines remain in their original locations.  Land lines are mapped as originally surveyed, even if the shorelines of meandered water bodies have changed.  Therefore, closure lines at water bodies should not be extended to or pulled back from the mapped shoreline where discrepancies exist.  In the past, land lines were broken at tract boundaries, but the tract limits themselves were not shown.  This most frequently occurred in the Rocky Mountain region.  In such cases, the arbitrary closure lines are digitized as straight line segments between nodes placed at the points where the land lines terminate.USGS/NMDUnited States Geological Survey/National Mapping Division00866 D     00041   310400010040DDDF8214444MDEF444ENT3000204Base line.  This is a line extending east and west along a true parallel of latitude passing through the initial point.

This code identifies non-PLSS lines dividing areas that are excluded from the PLSS.  It is used only on the lines that are completely within such excluded areas.
