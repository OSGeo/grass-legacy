In addition, PROSYS software (USGS) tests the attributes against a master set of valid attributes for the hydrography category; it also checks for selected valid attribute combinations, and for valid attributes relative to topology and dimensionality.  All attribute data conform to the attribute codes current as of the date of digitizing as described in Part 3:  Attribute Codes in "Standards for Digital Line Graphs", National Mapping Program Technical Instructions, USGS.  Accuracy is estimated to be 98.5 percent.  Certain attributes and/or entities, e.g. BEST_ESTIMATE, convey data quality information;  for details refer to the SDTS Data Dictionary Modules.
