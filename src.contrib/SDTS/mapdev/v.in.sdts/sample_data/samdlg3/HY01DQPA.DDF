NMAS horizontal accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inches of the true position.  The digital data are estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inches standard error in the two component directions relative to the source graphic.  NMAS vertical accuracy requires that at least 90% of well defined points tested be within one half contour interval of the correct value.  Comparison to the graphic source is used as control to assess digital positional accuracy.  Cartographic offsets may be present on the graphic source, due to scale and legibility constraints.  Digital map elements require edge alignment between data sets.  Data along each quadrangle edge are tested against the data set for the adjacent quadrangle;  tests check for positional accuracy between data sets within a 0.02 inches tolerance.  Features with like dimensionality, and with or without like attribution, that are within the tolerance are adjusted by moving the feature equally in both data sets.  Features outside the tolerance are not moved.  All disconnects are identified by edge matching flags that document the mismatch.  These edge matching flags are located in the SDTS AHDR Attribute Primary Module in subfields EDGEWS, EDGEWR, EDGENS, EDGENR, EDGEES, EDGEER, EDGESS, and EDGESR.  If the digital data underwent limited update revision, then the data meets at least the class 2 positional accuracy specification in the draft "United States National Cartographic Standards for Spatial Accuracy".  If the digital data underwent standard update revision, then the data meets the class 1 positional accuracy specifications.  Certain attributes and/or entities, e.g. BEST_ESTIMATE, convey data accuracy information;  for details refer to the SDTS Data Dictionary Modules.
