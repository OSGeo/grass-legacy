(The GT-polygon corresponds to the DLG area).  Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout the transfer, and the chains representing the limits of the file (neatline) are free of gaps.  The tests of logical consistency are performed by PROSYS (USGS) program.  The neatline is generated by connecting the four corners of the digital file, as established during initialization of the digital file.  All data outside the enclosed region are ignored and all data crossing these geographically straight lines are clipped at the neatline.  (Exception:  Early files may have area pointings outside of the neatline, for those areas which were too small to place the area pointing within, given software constraints at the time of collection.)  Data within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the neatline.  Neatline straightening aligns the digitized edges of the digital data with the generated neatline, that is, with the longitude/latitude lines in geographic coordinates.  All internal polygons are tested for closure; early files were checked using plots, later files were checked using PROSYS.  Certain attributes and/or entities, e.g. closure line, convey data quality information;  for details refer to the SDTS Data Dictionary Modules.  Throughout the transfer, null values are denoted by adjacent delimiters.  When a subfield, either user-defined in Attribute Primary and Attribute Secondary Module records, or in other SDTS Module records, is implemented as fixed-length, the following null scheme is used:  (a) when information to be encoded in the subfield is known to be not applicable (undefined, not relevant), then the subfield is valued by a string of spaces;  and (b) when the information to be encoded is relevant but unknown (or missing), then the subfield is valued by a string of question marks "?".
