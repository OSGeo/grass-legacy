.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBv.import\fR
.br
\fBv.import help\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program performs all of the processes that are needed to convert ascii DLG files, binary DLG files, ascii SCS-GEF files, ascii ARC Ungenerate files, ascii DXF files, and ascii vector files into binary vector files. It also creates support files, the dig_plus file and the dig_att file (only created when importing DLG, SCS-GEF, or ARC files). The dig_plus file contains topological information obtained by analyzing the vector file.  The dig_att file contains attribute information 'stripped' from the DLG file or SCS-GEF text data. This dig_att file is created for vector files by the labeling function of the GRASS digit program. 
.LP
\fBIMPORT FILES\fR
.br
After entering the command  v.import, the user will be asked which type of file to import and create support files for:
.LP
.NF
Import to GRASS Vector Format and Creates Needed Support Files
	1  -   Ascii DLG file  to GRASS Vector Format
	2  -   Binary DLG file to GRASS Vector Format
	3  -   Ascii DIGIT file  to GRASS Vector Format
	4  -   Binary DIGIT file to GRASS Vector Format
	5  -   Ascii SCS-GEF file to GRASS Vector Format
	6  -   Ascii ARC/INFO file to GRASS Vector Format
	7  -   Ascii DXF file to GRASS Vector Format
	8  -   Ascii TIGER file to GRASS Vector Format
.FI
.IP
If numbers 1-3 or 5-8 are chosen, v.import will respond with the current database units(in feet or meters), and ask if the new vector file is in the correct units for the database location.  If the new vector file is not in the correct units, v.import will not allow it to be placed in the current database location.  For each database location, all data layer should have the same units. If, for some reason, a data layer has different units than the rest of the data layers in the same database, a new database location will have to be created for it.
.LP
\fBAscii DLG File to GRASS Vector\fR
.br
Converts ascii DLG files (such as those created in GRASS) to a vector file and creates the dig_plus and dig_att support files. The user is asked several questions:
.IP
1. The name of the DLG data file. 
.br
.IP
NOTE: It should be available in the $LOCATION/dlg directory. If the DLG data has an attribute flat file, it should also be in $LOCATION/dlg.
.br
.IP
2. Determine if this map is composed of Area or Line information. 
.br
.IP
NOTE: Some machine-processed DLG files do not make the distinction between lines and area edges. For example, in a roads map, where the the desired information is line data, a downtown block surrounded by roads may be processed as an area.  Because of this, the user is asked to choose whether to give precedence to areas or lines.  If precedence is given to lines, the user should be aware that any lines that bound unlabeled areas in the DLG file will be stored as line data. Any unlabeled areas would therefore be lost (this is only a concern when areas are unlabeled, labeled area information will be retained). If precedence is given to areas, lines will be stored as boundaries to areas that are unlabeled.
.br
.IP
3. Determine if you want to snap nodes to other nodes within a threshold.
.br
.IP
NOTE: BE CAREFUL! This threshold is calculated using the scale of the original DLG or DIGIT file. If the threshold is too high, excessive snapping may occur, destroying the file.  In general, users seldom need to snap nodes. If snapping of nodes is desired, the user may want to run v.support separately. v.support allows the user to set the threshold.
.br
.IP
4. Does the DLG data contain GRASS category codes. 
.br
.IP
NOTE: Most non-GRASS computer systems will not be able to provide the necessary codes. The flat attribute file serves this purpose. If the answer to this question is NO:
.br
.IP
1) Enter a SUBJECT MATTER file name. 
.br
A subject file will be used to assign GRASS category codes to the DLG data. It is structured the same as a dig_cats category file. It is suggested that a SUBJ directory be created in the GRASS location and a file containing all DLG attribute text labels by category be created.  This will be required to provide consistancy across several maps (quads) within one location. The user may use the vi text editor or the SCS macro "make_subject" to create it.
.br
.IP
2) Enter a ATTRIBUTE file name.
.br
This is the name of the flat file which will accompany a DLG from a non-GRASS system. This file contains all of the DLG area numbers with a corresponding text label.
.br
.IP
3) Is the DLG data from an ARC/INFO system. 
.br
ARC/INFO DLG data is handled in a slightly different manner.
.br
.IP
4) Does The DLG contain a Universe Polygon.
.br
Some DLG files may or may NOT have this and processing will be required to handle each case differently.
.br
.IP
This process is done in three phases:
.br
.IP
1. If the DLG does NOT contain category codes, then a category file from the attribute file is created.  Then the ascii dlg file is converted to a binary dlg file.
.br
.IP
- OR -
.br
.IP
If the DLG does contain category codes, then the ascii dlg file is converted to a binary dlg file.
.br
.IP
2. The binary dlg file is converted to a binary vector file, and the dig_att support file containing attribute information is created.
.br
.IP
3. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing the vector file for topological information.
.LP
\fBBinary DLG File to GRASS Vector\fR
.br
Converts binary DLG files (which should be in the bdlg directory) to a vector file and creates the dig_plus and dig_att support files. The user is asked whether precedence should be given to Areas or Lines and if nodes should be snapped to other nodes within a calculated threshold.
.br
.IP
This process is done in two phases:
.br
.IP
1. The binary dlg file is converted to a binary vector file, and the dig_att support file containing attribute information is created.
.br
.IP
2. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing the vector file for topological information.
.br
.LP
\fBAscii Vector File into GRASS Vector\fR
.br
Converts ascii DIGIT files (which are located in dig_ascii directory) into binary vector files and creates the dig_plus support file. Since a vector file keeps the distinction between lines and area edges, the user is not asked to give precedence to either. However, the user will be asked if the user wants to snap from nodes to other nodes within a calculated threshold.
.br
.IP
This process is done in two phases:
.IP
1. The ascii vector file is converted to a binary vector file, and the dig_plus support file is created.
.br
.IP
2. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing the vector file for topological information.
.br
.LP
\fBBinary Vector File to GRASS Vector\fR
.br
Creates the dig_plus support file.
.br
.IP
This process is done in one phase:
.br
.IP
1. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing the vector file for topological information.
.br
.LP
\fBAcsii SCS-GEF File to GRASS Vector\fR
.br
Creates the dig_plus, dig_att, and dig_cat support files.  Creates a registration coordinates file.
.br
.IP
Allows a user to create a GRASS vector (digit) file from a SCS-GEF format ascii file.
.br
.IP
1.  The program will first request the name of the SCS-GEF file to be read in, it expects to find the data in the $LOCATION/gef directory. 
.br
.IP
2.  The program will then request the name of a GRASS vector (digit) file.
.br
.IP
3.  The program will then request the name of a SUBJECT file. A subject file will be used to assign GRASS category codes to the SCS-GEF data. It is structured the same as a dig_cats category file. It is suggested that a SUBJ directory be created in the GRASS location and a file containing all SCS-GEF text labels by category be created. This will be required to provide consistancy across several mapsets (quads) within one location. The user may use the vi text editor or the SCS macro "make_subject" to create it.
.br
.IP
4.  The program will then read the SCS-GEF header information, interactively present information that was available, and request additional data of the user. These questions are :
.br
.NF
           Name of their organization. (from SCS-GEF)
           Digitized Date.             (from SCS-GEF)
           Map Name.                   (from SCS-GEF)
           Map Location.               (from SCS-GEF)
           Other Information.          (from SCS-GEF)
           State FIPS code.
           County FIPS code.
           Present GEF Coord. System (table, stplane, ll, utm).
           Coord. System Desired (utm, stplane, ll, albers).
.FI
.IP
The program will then actively read the SCS-GEF data file and process it, 
.br
.IP
Note: scripts contains SCS macro make_1_gef. This macro makes one file out of the three(3) files found in SCS-GEF ( see SCS-GEF technical specifications for more information). The macro must be run on each data set BEFORE v.import.
.br
.LP
\fBAscii ARC/INFO Ungenerate Format Files to GRASS Vector\fR
.br
Creates the dig_plus, dig_att, and dig_cat support files.
.br
The program will prompt you to enter the names of ARC/INFO files to be imported to GRASS.  ARC/INFO vector files to be imported into GRASS must be exported from ARC/INFO using the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.   ARC/INFO vector files which are to are to be imported to GRASS, must be either line or polygon coverages. They must also be placed in a $LOCATION/arc directory. The section of the ARC/INFO manual that cover the Ungenerate command describes how to export line and polygon coverages.  
.br
.IP
A polygon coverage is represented by three files:
.IP
1) a lines file, which contains coordiates of all the area edge lines;
.br
2) label-point file, which contains coordintes of label-points each with a unique label-point ID number.  There is one label-point for each polygon defined in the lines file; and
.br
3) a label-text file, which associates label-point ID number with a category number and attribute text.
.br
.IP
A line coverage is represented by two files: 
.br
.IP
1) a lines file, which contains coordiates of of the lines, each with a line-ID number; and
.br
2) a label-text file, which associates each line-ID number with a category number and attribute text.
.br
.IP
The program will start out by asking you which type of coverage is to be imported, as follows:
.br
.IP
IMPORTING A POLYGON COVERAGE
.br
The prompts that will be presented for coverage type "polygon."
.NF
             COVERAGE TYPE
             Enter "polygon" or "line"
             Hit RETURN to cancel request
             >
        Answer "polygon"

             NEATLINE
             Do you want a neatline ?
             Enter "yes" or "no"
             > 
        If you answer yes then vectors representing 
	a box around the data will be inserted into
	the resulting GRASS vector file, otherwise 
	no neatline will be created.
.FI
.LP
Next the program will prompt for the name of the lines-file containing the arc coodinates of the polygons.  The lines-file is created with the Ungenerate LINES option and is the same format as the map_name.pol file created by the program.  The following is the prompt: 
.NF
              LINES FILENAME
             Enter name of the file created with the LINES 
             option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
             Hit RETURN to cancel request
             >
.FI
.br
The next prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the name of the label-points file.  The label-points files is created with the Ungenerate POINTS option and is the same format as the mapname.lab file created by the export.vect ARC program. The following is the prompt:
.NF
             LABEL-POINTS FILENAME
            Enter name of file created with the POINTS 
            option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command. 
            Hit RETURN if there is no such file 
            >
.FI
.br
The last prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the name of the label-text file.  This file associates each label-point ID number with a text string and is the same format as the mapname.txt file created by the export.vect ARC program.  The following is the prompt: 
.NF
             LABEL-TEXT FILENAME
            Enter the name of a file that associates
            label-point ID numbers with text label strings
            Hit RETURN if there is no such file
            > 
.FI
.br
The program will then scan the label-text file to determine how many columns are in the file and to determine which column should be used as the label-point ID number column.  
.br
The program will then tell you how many lines and columns are in the label-text file.  Next you will be prompted to enter the number of the column to be used for GRASS category values.  The category number column MUST contain only integers.
.br
.NF
              Enter the number of the column that is to be used 
              for GRASS category values:
.FI
.LP
and the number the column to be used for GRASS attribute text. The attribute text column can contain a floating point number, an integer, or a word.
.br
.NF
              Enter the number of the column that should be used 
              for GRASS attribute text: 
.FI
.LP
Once you enter the category and attribute column numbers, the program will begin conversion of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate files into GRASS vector format.
.br
.LP
IMPORTING A LINE COVERAGE
.br
First, you are prompted for the name of the lines-file containing the arc coordinates of the lines.  The lines-file is created with the Ungenerate LINES option and is the same format as the mapname.lin file created by the export.vect ARC program. 
.NF
               LINES FILENAME
              Enter name of the file created with the lines
              option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
              Hit RETURN to cancel request
              >
.FI
.br
The last prompt for coverage type "line" asks for the name of the label-text file.  This file associates each line-ID number with a text string and is the same format as the mapname.txt file created by the export.vect ARC program.
.NF
               LABEL-TEXT FILENAMES
              Enter name of file associating line ID numbers 
              numbers with label text. 
              Hit RETURN if there is no such file 
              >
.FI
.br
The program will scan the label-text file to determine how many columns are in the file and will then tell yo u how many columns are in the label-text.  Next you will be prompted to enter the number of the column to be used for line-ID numbers. 
.br
.NF
              Enter the number of the column that is to be used
              for line-ID numbers:
.FI
.LP
Next you will be prompted to enter the number of the column to be used for GRASS category values.  The category number column MUST contain only integers.
.br
.NF
              Enter the number of the column that is to be used
              for GRASS category values:
.FI
.LP
and the number of the column to be used for GRASS attribute text.  The attribute text column can contain a floating point number, an integer, or a word.
.br
.NF
              Enter the number of the column that should be used as
              for GRASS attribute text: 
.FI
.LP
Once you enter the column numbers the program will begin conversion of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate files into GRASS vector format.
.br
.LP
DATA FILE FORMATS
.br
Following are examples of the data files discussed in the section above.
.br
.IP
LINES FILE, also known as xxx.lin or xxx.pol file.  This type of file can be created in ARC/INFO by using the lines subcommand of the Ungenerate command.   Each line, or arc, is defined by a line-ID number, followed by a list of at least two easting and northing coordinate pairs, followed by a line with the word "END".  The file is terminated with the word "END".
.br
The line-ID number is only important for line coverages.  For a line coverage, the line-ID number is the number that associates each line with its attribute data.

NOTES
.br
When importing a polygon coverage, the program finds the label-point ID in a label-text file by looking for the second column in the file that contains a "1" on line 1, and a "2" on line 2.
.br
If you are missing a label-points or a label-text file you can still import ARC/INFO data (but none of your lines or areas will be labelled).

\fBAscii DXF Format Files to GRASS Vector\fR
.br
Creates the dig_plus, dig_att, and dig_cat support files.
.br
.LP
\fBAscii TIGER Format Files to GRASS Vector\fR
.br
This program imports census line features from TIGER records type1 and type2 into GRASS vector format.  Both pre-census and post-census data formats can be used.  Specific Census Feature Class Codes (CFCC) can be extracted completely or in various combinations.  These codes are described in the TIGER/line Census Files 1990 documemtation available from the Bureau of the Census.  An additional feature code consisting of the three letters "BOU" may also be specified to extract a county boundary.  Condensed Record 1 files may be imported with the -c flag.  These files should be identified with a trailing "x" character on the filename.
.br
The TIGER files must in sorted order before being used.  This can be done by using the following command:
.NF
	sort TGR12113.F21 -o t12113.1 
	sort TGR12113.F22 -o t12113.2
.FI
.br
For consistency the sorted file should be written as above.  It should consist of a 't' followed by the State and County FIPS code, then a '.' and then a value to identify the record number.
