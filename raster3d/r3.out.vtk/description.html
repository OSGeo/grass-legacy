<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Outputs <I>G3D</I> maps in <I>VTK-ASCII</I> format.  <I>Map's</I> are
valid G3D map's in the current mapset.  <I>output</I> is the name of
an VTK-ASCII file which will be written in the current working directory.
If <I>output</I> is not specified then <B>stdout</B> is used.  
The module is sensitive to region settings (set with g.region).

<H2>NOTES</H2>
This filter generates <I>structured points</I> with <I>celldata</I> (default) or <I>pointdata</I>. 
If requested a <I>structured grid</I> with a top and bottom surface and <I>pointdata</I> are generated.
This data is put in a simple VTK-ASCII file. Nor XML or 
binary output are supported. It is possible to choose more then one G3D map
to be written in the VTK-ASCII file. Each celldata is named like the G3D map it represents.
You can visualize this file with the 
<EM><A HREF="http://www.vtk.org">VTK Toolkit</A></EM>, 
<EM><A HREF="http://www.paraview.org">Paraview</A></EM> and 
<EM><A HREF="http://mayavi.sourceforge.net">MayaVi</A></EM> which are based on VTK.
If you have a G3D map with partly no data, use the threshold filter in paraview to 
visualize the valid data. Just filter all data which is greater/lesser than the 
choosen null value in the VTK-ASCII file.

<H3>Difference between point- and celldata</H3>

<em>r3.out.vtk</em> can export G3D cells with different representations.
<ul>
   <li>
      <I>pointdata</I> -- the cells/values are represented by the center of the cell. 
      Instead of cells, points are created. Each point can hold different values, 
      but the user can only visualize one value at a time. 
   </li>
   <li>
       <I>celldata</I>  
       The cells are created with the same hight, width and depth as in GRASS. Each cell 
       can hold different values, but the user can only visualize one value at a time. 
   </li>
</ul>
