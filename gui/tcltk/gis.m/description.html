<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <b>GRASS GIS Manager</b>
provides an interactive graphical interface to GRASS commands. By
default, it is started automatically with each GRASS session. The GIS
Manager can be quit by selecting the <em>'File-&gt;Exit</em><em>'</em>
menu item. The GIS Manager can be restarted from the GRASS command line
shell by typing "<i>gis.m &amp;</i>".<br>
<br>
The GIS Manager includes a set of pull-down menus for many GIS
functions (analysis, file I/O, GIS configuration and management), two
rows of buttons that manage display layers, an upper window in
which layers to display are organized, a row of display monitor control
buttons along the left side of the layer tree window, and a lower
window which contains options panels for layers in the layer tree. <br>
<br>
The top left button opens a new map display window. Each map display
has a unique set of layers to display and region setting (zoom). Other
buttons add layers of different types for display in the selected map
display window. There are additional buttons for saving or opening
group display file, starting NVIZ
(n-dimensional visualization) or XGANIM (display animator) display
interfaces, and digitizing. <em><b>Mouse-over help</b></em>
is available for all buttons.<br>
<br>
Map layers are organized as a layer tree, in the window below the
buttons. Layers can include raster and vector maps, text, map
enhancements (scale and north arrow, grids, and frames), and commands
(where any GRASS command be written). Layers are displayed in as arranged
in the layer tree: the bottom layer
is displayed first and the top is displayed last, as if
layers are a series of stacked overlays. Any layer can be
renamed by double clicking on its name and typing a new name.<br>
<br>
The check box to the left of each layer makes it active for display.
Active layers are only displayed/redisplayed when the display button is
pressed. Layers can be organized into groups; entire groups can be
activated or deactivated for display. Groups can be saved to a file and
opened in subsequent sessions, restoring all layers and their display
options.<br>
<br>
When a layer is selected with the mouse, its options are shown in the
panel below the layer tree window. Help for each layer type can be
accessed by pressing the GRASS button in the option panel.<br>
<br>
Each map display has a unique layer tree and region setting (zoom).
Buttons on each map display manage the map in the display (zoom and
pan), provide tools for query and distance measurement, and exporting
or printing the display. The geographic coordinates under the cursor
are displayed in the indicator window (lower right window frame).<br>
<br>
A separate console window shows all commands issued and all command
output (upper window). GRASS commands (and any other unix/linux
commands) can be run from the console (lower window).<br>

<h3>Redisplay all active layers and zoom to current region</h3>

<img src="icons/gui-zoom_current.gif"> Resets the region to
the resolution and extents to the values set with g.region; forces redisplay and re-rendering
all active layers. <i>See <a href="g.region.html">g.region</a>.</i>

<h3>NVIZ</h3>
<img src="icons/module-nviz.gif"> Starts the NVIZ, n-dimensional visualization module and interactive
graphical interface. All active raster and vector layers in the layer
tree will be displayed in NVIZ. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="nviz.html">nviz</a></span><a href="nviz.html">.</a>
<h3>Erase to white</h3>

<img src="icons/gui-erase.gif"> Erases the currently selected monitor to a white background; also removes all frames. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.erase.html">d.erase</a> and <a href="d.frame.html">d.frame</a> -e.</span>

<h3>Zoom in</h3>
<img src="icons/gui-zoom_in.gif"> Interactive zooming with the mouse in the active display monitor.
Drawing a box with the mouse (left button) and zoom-in cursor causes
the display to zoom in so that the area defined by the box fills the
display. The map resolution is not changed. Clicking with the zoom-in
cursor causes the display to zoom in by 30%, centered on the point
where the mouse is clicked. Zooming resets the region extents (both
size and location of area
displayed). <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="g.region.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">g.region</span></a>.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

</span>
<h3>Zoom out</h3>

<img src="icons/gui-zoom_out.gif"> Interactive zooming with the mouse in the active display monitor.
Drawing a box with the mouse (left button) and zoom-out cursor causes the display to
zoom in so that the area displayed shrinks to fill the area defined by the box. The map
resolution is not changed. Clicking with the zoom-out cursor causes the
display to zoom out by 30%, centered on the point where the mouse is
clicked. Zooming resets the region extents (both size and location of
area
displayed). <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="g.region.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">g.region</span></a>.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pan</span></h3>

<img src="icons/gui-pan.gif"> Interactive selection of a new
center of view in the active display monitor. Drag the pan cursor while
pressing the left mouse button to pan. Panning changes the
location of the region extents but not the size of the area displayed
or the resolution.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="g.region.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">g.region</span></a>.</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h3>Query (select map first)</h3>

<img src="icons/gui-query.gif"> Query selected raster (only the base map of a draped map will be
queried), RGB raster map (all three map channels will be queried), or
vector map using the mouse. A map must be
selected before query.
&nbsp;Vector charts and thematic vector maps cannot be queried. The
results of the query will be displayed in the console window.<span style="font-style: italic;"> See <a href="r.what.html">r.what</a> and <a href="v.what.html">v.what</a></span>.<br>

<h3>Measure lengths</h3>
<img src="icons/gui-measure.gif"> Interactive measurement of lengths defined with the mouse. The length
of each segment and the cumulative length of all segments measuered is
displayed in the console window. Lengths are
measured in the current measurement unit. <span style="font-style: italic;">See also <a href="d.measure.html">d.measure</a>.</span><br>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Return to previous zoom</span></h3>

<img src="icons/gui-zoom_back.gif"> Resets the region to the region extents in effect prior to zooming in or out, or panning.

<h3>Display active layers (saved region)</h3>

<img src="icons/gui-zoom_region.gif">  Opens a dialog to select a saved region setting. Resets the region to
the resolution and extents of the selected saved region, and displays
all active layers.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="g.region.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">g.region</span></a>.</span>

<h3>Display active layers (default region)</h3>

<img src="icons/gui-zoom_default.gif"> Resets the region to the default resolution and extents, and displays all
active layers.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="g.region.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">g.region</span></a> -d.</span>

<h3>Print map</h3>
<img src="icons/file-print.gif"> Prints map on lpr printer or postscript device; saves visible map
display (including postscript text and labels) to PDF or EPS file.
Requires ghostscript for all output except EPS.

<h3>Export map display</h3>
<img src="icons/file-save.gif"> Exports visible map display to different raster map formats. Exported map does not include postscript text or postscript labels.

<h3>Strict draw mode</h3>
<img src="icons/drawmode-strict.gif"> Selects strict draw mode. In strict mode the aspect ratio and resolution from the last zoom are used when drawing the maps. The map will show only the area and resolution selected. It will not usually fill the screen. Strict mode only shows what is asked for.

<h3>Explore draw mode</h3>
<img src="icons/drawmode-explore.gif"> Selects explore draw mode. In explore mode the region from the last zoom is expanded to fill the entire screen. The resolution is adjusted to match the screen resolution. Explore mode shows as much as possible.

<h2>Configuration: changing fonts</h2>

Fonts used in <em>gis.m</em> can be changed as follows:
<ul>
<li>Source code: edit file 'lib/gtcltk/options.tcl' and compile gtcltk
<li>Runtime: edit file '$GISBASE/etc/gtcltk/options.tcl'
</ul>

<h2>Georectify tool</h2>

Start out in the location/mapset where you want the georectified map to END
UP (i.e., the projected TARGET location). Open any map display (or displays)
that you want to use for getting geographic coordinates.
<P>
Select <em>Georectify</em> from the <em>File</em> menu

In the <em>Georectify</em> startup, you must:

<ol>
<li> select if you want to geocode a raster or vector map,
<li> select the mapset of the file to be georectified (the location and
  gisdbase are automatically noted),
<li> create a group to georectify. Target is automatically
  set to the current location and mapset,
<li> select the group to georectify,
<li> select the raster map to display for interactive georectification
    (normally a raster in the group you want to georectify),
<li> click on <em>georectification</em> button to start the search for ground 
 control points.
</ol>

You will have a map display with the map to georectify and a GCP (ground
control point) manager window.
<ol>
<li> Click in an xy entry box in the GCP manager,
<li> Click on the xy map you want to georectify to put xy coordinates in
  the entry box. The focus will shift to the corresponding geographic entry
  box in the GCP manager,
<li> Click on a point in a georectified map to get geographic coordinates
  (use Pointer icon),
<li> Repeat until you have enough xy and geographic coordinate pairs.
</ol>

NOTE: you can edit/enter any point by typing. You can also edit
existing points by clicking on a new spot in the display.
<P>
Click the button to save the points to a POINTS file
<P>
Click on the <em>georectify</em> button to select the type of georectification you
want (polynomial order).
